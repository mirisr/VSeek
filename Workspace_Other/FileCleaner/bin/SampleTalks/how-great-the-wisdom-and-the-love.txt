I stand here with a humble hearta heart that is full of love for this work, for you people who are here and who are listening. At our last conference six months ago as I stood here by President Gordon B. Hinckley, he encouraged me to wave to you, and I used all the energy that I had. Ive heard from some people who thought I was waving a farewell. But Ive come here today to indicate to you and to tell you Im back. And I dont have anyone else pushing my arm for me.
I understand the power of prayer and of faith and devotion, and I acknowledge precious witnesses from heaven. And so I stand here today just to bear my testimony and say hello to you. Im hoping that by another conference Ill be totally healed and able to do what Im asked to do.
God lives. He is our Fatherour Father in Heaven.Eliza R. Snow, who wrote some of our famous music, particularly sacrament music, wrote the words:Just run that through your mind for a second. Because we were there.We chose to come here. And so were here assembled in this vast auditorium, where we can speak to each other and bear witness and bear testimony. I assure you that in those sleepless nights that Ive had at times, when you attempt to solve all of your problems and to make new resolutions of things that need to be done, I have had those heavenly thoughts that lift us. God our Heavenly Father loves us, as we should love Him. He selected His Son to come to earth and bring the gospel of Jesus Christ, for whom this Church is named and which we bear witness to. I am honored to stand and bear witness today of the foundation of this Church and of our love for President Hinckley, who leads us today.The gospel is true. I know it; Im a witness of it. In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, amen.
