Elder DallinH. Oaks, in April general conference, spoke of the need to reform our personal lives.1 I submit that personal reformation begins with a change of heartno matter your life experiences or your place of birth.I come from the Deep South of the United States, and in my youth the words of old Protestant hymns taught me of a true disciples heartone that has been changed. Consider these lyrics, so dear to me:How do we, a modern, busy, competitive people, become yielded and still? How do we make the Lords ways our ways? I believe we begin by learning of Him and praying for understanding. As our trust in Him grows, we open our hearts, seek to do His will, and wait for answers that will help us understand.My own change of heart started when, as a 12-year-old, I began to search for God. Other than saying the Lords Prayer,3 I didnt really know how to pray. I remember kneeling, hoping I could feel His love, and asking, Where are You, Heavenly Father? I know You must be out there somewhere, but where? All through my teen years, I asked. I did have glimpses of the reality of Jesus Christ, but Heavenly Father, in His wisdom, let me seek and wait for 10 years.In 1970, when the missionaries taught me about the Fathers plan of salvation and of the Saviors Atonement, my waiting ended. I embraced these truths and was baptized.Based on this knowledge of the Lords mercy and power, my husband, children, and I chose this family motto: It will all work out. Yet how can we say those words to one another when deep troubles come and answers arent readily available?When our delightful, worthy, 21-year-old daughter, Georgia, was hospitalized in critical condition following a bike accident, our family said, It will all work out. As I flew immediately from our mission in Brazil to Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, to be with her, I clung to our family motto. However, our lovely daughter passed into the spirit world just hours before my plane landed. With grief and shock running through our family like a current, how could we look at one another and still say, It will all work out?Following Georgias mortal death, our feelings were raw, we struggled, and still today we have moments of great sorrow, but we hold to the understanding that no one ever really dies. Despite our anguish when Georgias physical body stopped functioning, we had faith that she went right on living as a spirit, and we believe we will live with her eternally if we adhere to our temple covenants. Faith in our Redeemer and His Resurrection, faith in His priesthood power, and faith in eternal sealings let us state our motto with conviction.President GordonB. Hinckley said: If you do your best, it will all work out. Put your trust in God. The Lord will not forsake us.4Our family motto doesnt say, It will all work out now. It speaks of our hope in the eternal outcomenot necessarily of present results. Scripture says, Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good.5This doesnt mean all things are good, but for the meek and faithful,thingsboth positive and negativework together for good, and the timing is the Lords. We wait on Him, sometimes like Job in his suffering, knowing that God maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.6 A meek heart accepts the trial and the waiting for that time of healing and wholeness to come.When we openourselves to the Spirit, we learn Gods way and feel His will. During the sacrament, which I call the heart of the Sabbath, I have found that after I pray for forgiveness of sins, it is instructive for me to ask Heavenly Father, Father, is there more? When we are yieldedand still, our minds can be directed to something more we may need to changesomething that is limiting our capacity to receive spiritual guidance or even healing and help.For example, perhaps I have a carefully guarded resentment toward someone. When I ask if there is more to confess, that secret comes clearly to my memory. In essence, the Holy Ghost is whispering, You honestly asked if there wasmore, and here it is. Your resentment diminishes your progress and damages your ability to have healthy relationships. You can let this go. Oh, it is hard workwe may feel quite justified in our animositybut yielding to the Lords way is the only way to lasting happiness.In time and by degrees, we receive His gracious strength and directionperhaps leading us to frequent the temple or to study more deeply the Saviors Atonement or to consult with a friend, a bishop, a professional counselor, or even a doctor. The healing of our heart begins when we submit to and worship God.True worship begins when our hearts are right before the Father and the Son. What is our heart condition today? Paradoxically, in order to have a healed and faithful heart, we must first allow it to break before the Lord. Ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit,7 the Lord declares. The result of sacrificing our heart, or our will, to the Lord is that we receive the spiritual guidance we need.With a growing understanding of the Lords grace and mercy, we will find that our self-willed hearts begin to crack and break in gratitude. Then we reach for Him, yearning to yoke ourselves to the Only Begotten Son of God. In our brokenhearted reaching and yoking, we receive new hope and fresh guidance through the Holy Ghost.I have struggled to banish the mortal desire to have things my way, eventually realizing that my way is oh so lacking, limited, and inferior to the way of Jesus Christ. His way is the path that leads to happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.8 Can we love Jesus Christ and His way more than we love ourselves and our own agenda?Some may think they have failed too many times and feel too weak to change sinful acts or worldly desires of the heart. However, as covenant Israel, we dont just try and try on our own to change. If we earnestly appeal to God, He takes us as we areand makes us more than we ever imagined. Noted theologian RobertL. Millet writes of a healthy longing to improve, balanced with the spiritual assurance that in and through Jesus Christ we are going to make it.9 With such an understanding, we can honestly say to Heavenly Father:When we offer our broken heart to Jesus Christ, He accepts our offering. He takes us back. No matter what losses, wounds, and rejection we have suffered, His grace and healing are mightier than all. Truly yoked to the Savior, we can say with confidence, It will all work out. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
