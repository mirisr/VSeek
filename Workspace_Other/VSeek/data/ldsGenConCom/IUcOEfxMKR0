I play this rendition daily as a heart soothing hymn.﻿wonderful piece. perfect rythm﻿God guides us first through his Word, then through our heartfelt desires, 
then the wise counsel of others, and then our circumstances. At that point 
we must rely on our own sound judgment…… . God gave each of us a brain, and 
he expects us to put it to good use﻿The Power of the Lord in these wonderfull voices and music! THK U MTB! <3﻿
