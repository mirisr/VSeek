These young girls are just the cutest and I loved how Sister Burton told 
everyone in her talk that she loved all of us it was really neat hearing 
her Korean she served in Korea for a mission﻿This was my favorite part of Women's Conference :)﻿Me encantó escucharlas en la Reunion General de las Mujeres Jóvenes, son 
unas niñas muy hermosas con sus Hanbok :')﻿
