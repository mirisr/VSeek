I'm so sorry, but this was muted for some reason.  I'm blind, and I thought 
that this wasn't playing.  Come to find out, it was muted.  I don't know 
why, because I always keep things unmuted on YouTube.  I apologize for the 
inconvenience.﻿This is to inform you that this video does not play.  Could you please 
check on this and fill me in?  I'm not a member of the LDS Church, but I 
believe these conference recordings are available for the general public.  
I  really appreciate it.  I've always wanted to listen to President Boyd K. 
Packer when he was younger.  Thank you very much.﻿
