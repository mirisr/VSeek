I love this talk.  It helped me so much while I was on my mission.  I'm so 
glad my mission president gave every new missionary a copy of this talk.
6:39 Testimony and Conversion are defined and stated so simply it opened my 
understanding of the two.  Once I understood the two, scripture reading 
became more insightful.  I could see the patterns that were happening 
throughout the Book of Mormon and the Bible and how they applied to my life.
Thanks +LDS General Conference for putting up these talks.  I'm grateful 
that we have apostles on the Earth again today.ï»¿
