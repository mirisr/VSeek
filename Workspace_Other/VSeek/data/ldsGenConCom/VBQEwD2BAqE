I LOVE this talk!  It is so spot-on for all women of all righteous faiths 
today.  I am grateful for women who will stand for God's plan of happiness 
and obey His eternal laws.  Together my husband and I taught our seven 
children to value the individual roles of man and woman, and the joys AND 
responsibilities of making a happy home for your family.  Thank you Sis. 
Oscarson, for this clarion call to women of good faith today to stand up 
for the exalting plan of our Heavenly Father - a strong family built on a 
strong, Godly foundation. "Long ago and far away all circles once began,/ 
and the greatest circle ever drawn was a child, a woman, and a man."ï»¿
