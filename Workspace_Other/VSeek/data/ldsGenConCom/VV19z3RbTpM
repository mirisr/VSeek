Brothers, sister, You have to understand they didn't yell out to be 
disruptive. they yelled out "opposed" to make sure their hand and their 
views weren't lost or overlooked in that sea of people at conference. There 
really is no reason to be troubled or upset by this. In fact, this is why 
we have the "support or oppose" system here at the LDS church.﻿I sustain the prophets and apostles.﻿
