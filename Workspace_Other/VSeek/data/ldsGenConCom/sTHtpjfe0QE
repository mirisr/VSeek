This is one of the hymns I selected for my baptism. Still one of my 
favorites. This is so soothing!ï»¿I love that song . thats one of many hymns i love . it allways brings my to 
tears .ï»¿when i was on my missiÃ³n, i started to read the Hymns like scriptures, and 
after playing this hymn in one sacrament meeting i felt the spirit so much 
that i was about to cry, then i searched for this song sang by the mormon 
tabernacle choir but i couldn't find it. and then after i searched a lot, 
in the April 2014 conference at Sunday afternoon session i heard it  and i 
knew that all my prayers were answer at this moment.ï»¿Sometimes, one hymn has more power than a thousand sermons. There is 
nothing like a powerful hymn that reminds you of the love the Lord has for 
you and then strengthens your resolve to keep your covenants that you have 
made with Him.ï»¿Love this hymn ï»¿beauty!!ï»¿Hymn # 193,  "I Stand All Amazed" has always been one of my favorite hymns. 
I just love it when we sing it in Sacrament, sadly, not often enough for 
me, so I come here to listen to it as often as I like, or play it on the 
Organ, but my voice just isn't what it used to be... This was April 2014, 
just 1 year ago from this past Saturday & Sundays' 185th bi-annual General 
Conference... "We Thank The Oh God, For A Prophet"ï»¿Who is the arranger? I love this version.ï»¿I LOVE this SONGï»¿I like & love it very much all the hymns that was sang by Tabernacle Quire. 
Upliftment of my spiritual sense.......ï»¿i love this songï»¿Oh it is just so so wonderful man, that is all as I can put it just so 
wonderful to meðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥ï»¿
