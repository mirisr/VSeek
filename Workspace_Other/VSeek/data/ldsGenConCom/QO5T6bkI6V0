I just found out about Elder Richards. His Oct 1972 Talk was epic!﻿I loved this talk when Elder Richards gave it, and especially at the end 
when he ended it abruptly. He was one of the great ones! He could expound 
on the doctrines without ceasing until they told him his time was up. And 
his words are still just as relevant today! The Spirit of Elijah is here 
and is even more powerful than when he delivered these words many years 
ago!﻿
