Love listening to Young Men sing!! So cool to see 2 boys from my high 
school singing there together﻿I love it!  my brother was in the MTC then so he was able to sing with 
them!  It was an awesome experience to find him in that choir and to hear 
the beautiful music!  ﻿I wish I could find this sheet music.  Does anyone know if it's published?﻿I loved singing these songs in primary, I really like how they were put 
together here too.﻿
