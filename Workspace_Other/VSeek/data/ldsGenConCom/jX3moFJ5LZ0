This is in your face encouragement for to live the better life. Thank you 
President Uchtdorf.﻿I was able to meet Dieter in Salzburg, Austria. He is the real deal. He 
teaches common sense, but common sense isn't common. Follow those who have 
results!!! ﻿He is just uber =)﻿This is sound advice, instruction and doctrine.  Grateful to God today for 
the restoration of the Gospel.﻿I am a little biased when it comes to uchtdorf!! I enjoy his talks because 
I feel like hes speaking directly to me sometimes!﻿This was a great talk! I'm grateful to the Savior who helps relieve life's 
burdens and creates a positive interchange that makes me happier!﻿
