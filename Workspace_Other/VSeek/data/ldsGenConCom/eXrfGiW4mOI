Elder Richard G. Scott is marvelous as are all men and women when they 
speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost therefore speaking in behalf of our 
Godhead – Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.
Elder Scott, being one of 15 special witnesses of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
knows from Whom, from which, from where, and to whom he testifies and 
speaks firsthand.
We would all do well to listen to this special witness for whom he is a 
special ambassador inviting all to listen to Jesus Christ, the Prince Of 
Peace and therefore speak, act, do, study, and therefore become as Jesus is 
– to have us transformed into a Prince or Princess of Peace.
Whether Jew or Gentile, Christian or non-Christian, believer or 
nonbeliever, what our world needs now more than ever before is peace. Go 
out and be a symbol of peace. Let it begin now and today with you and me.

things proceed that which is great.﻿
