The Son said, to this effect, "Many are called, few are chosen." He also 
spoke of it as a 'bitter cup'. While I find comfort in knowing this, I 
believe we also share in the Son's sorrows, when we walk in His path. The 
shooting at the AME church, yesterday, has shaken me greatly. Not my faith, 
but in that I feel His pain. It's difficult, as this single tragedy isn't 
completely the pain I feel. For it is a continual suffering, for many.

Brother Perry was right, in feeling that the Children of God are at a 
precipice. We must oil our lamps. We must prepare the way. None know the 
Day, nor the Time. Yet, we certainly can feel, even in such sorrows, the 
greatness that awaits us, when we ready ourselves.

Light has no shadow, no secrets, and welcomes all to sincerely be in its 
presence. The same is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit's, and it is also 
our own, being His Children. Let us share this Light with one another, 
today. There is no telling, with our own minds, what tomorrow brings. :'( 
And yet, even in great sorrow, there is a great joy, knowing of the 
atonement. :')ï»¿
