Fayette Lapham, who spoke with the Smiths at length to find out firsthand 
about Mormonism, said, "This Joseph Smith, Senior, we soon learned, from 
his own lips, was a firm believer in witchcraft and other supernatural 
things; and had brought up his family in the same belief" (Historical 
Magazine, 7 May 1870, p. 306).

Today the endowment is the same ceremony which is done in Wicca and 
Satanism! EXACTLY. Getting a new name, hand shakes going through the viel 
etc, even the garments and the symbols on them are the same. I am a former 
Occultist and Mormon of many years.

Smith stole the Masonic ceremony from the Masons. The Masons got it from 
the Occult....AKA Witchcraft!!!ï»¿
