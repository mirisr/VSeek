Love this talk by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland. Even the Son of man was 
homeless. Look to the poor and needy that they shall not suffer.﻿
No matter how many times I listen to these  talks  I feel the Spirit.  If 
you need a break from the world,  listen to these great  Conference talks, 
 they bring peace, rest and  comfort  to the soul.﻿Without a doubt, a servant and true apostle of the Lord﻿I am definitely a beggar. Grateful for a Savior.﻿
