I can't believe this video hasn't garnered even one comment; until now, and 
I'm not even a Latter-Day Saint. This is one of President Monson's best 
talks. It is obvious that age is catching up with him, and that the use of 
the teleprompter helps keep him on point; but that doesn't take away from 
the power of the message! As he has so often said, "Whom God calls, God 
qualifies." ï»¿
