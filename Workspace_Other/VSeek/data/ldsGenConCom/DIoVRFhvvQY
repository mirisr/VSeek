choir sings 6:55﻿for 2 reasons I remember this general conference afternoon session, the 
first when the YW sing How Sweet t'was the morning and a very shaky 
struggling Elder Joseph B. Worthlin giving his talk.﻿Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin speaks with difficulty after long standing while 
giving his talk, Elder Nelson gives his assistance to balance him up.﻿
