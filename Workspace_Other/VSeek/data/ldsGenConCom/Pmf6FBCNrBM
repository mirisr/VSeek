Is there a place I can download this clip?﻿I love Elder Hollands talks so much because each and every time he speaks 
he does it with humility and grace.He puts a face on all of his messages.I 
also love the example that President Monson sets giving the very shoes off 
his feet and the extra clothes he had to those less fortunate.Such a act of 
love and kindness.Im grateful for First Presidency,The Quorum Of The Twelve 
and all the Teachers whom have been chosen and sent.﻿Thank you for this wonderful message Elder Holland.﻿Having felt want, there was not pity, but all at once there was charity.﻿are we not all beggars and we cry out for help?﻿How humble I feel that this revealing information comes to help us see 
light and truth for aw ay to direct my activities as the hands of Jesus 
Christ.﻿
