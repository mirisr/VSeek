This is a wonderful talk that touched my heart very deeply.  It 
encapsulated all of the reasons for and blessings of family history and 
temple work in a marvelous way. Families can be forever and doing the 
things which Elder Neuenschwander recommends in this talk will certainly 
help that become a reality!ï»¿
