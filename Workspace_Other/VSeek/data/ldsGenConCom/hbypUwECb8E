God Loves me.﻿I am just astonished by his great dept of understanding about the grace of 
God.
The message of this talk makes me humble before God.﻿Of all the marvelous talks I've listen to so far, this one has not only 
inspired me but taught me about this important doctrine point. Thanks, 
President Uchtdorf!﻿The destiny of man lay fulfilled
On the day the atonement was made
When Christ broke the bands of Satan's chains
And the sins of mankind where marked, "PAID!"﻿The Savior's gift of love and grace
Was perfectly put into place
He broke sin's chains, the curse of death
As He paid in full for all our debt
Mercy and justice came at a high price
He selflessly suffered in sacrifice
We must never forget all that He has done
To save us, cleanse us, redeem and atone﻿I am grateful that President Uchtdorf willingly serves in this capacity. 
His talks really help me understand principles and accept truth.﻿This is a good speech ﻿
