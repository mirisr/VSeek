This is one of my favorite talks ever. During this meeting, the Young Women 
sang an amazing version of "Carry On!" There was a cassette tape of that 
song and the talk that I listened to for years! I have looked and looked 
and cannot find another recording of it. Do you have some way to access 
that? (27 Sept 1986 General Women's Meeting---females age 10 and up.)ï»¿
