I love this talk. Families are a cornerstone to raising future generations 
of respectful hard working decent people.﻿It's time to become "revolutionaries," as the Pope and Elder Perry said, 
and stand up for traditional families.﻿may he rest in peace﻿Thank you Elder Perry for your life of service and shining example. Your 
words of wisdom are greatly needed in our world. God be with you until we 
meet again. ﻿Rest In Peace﻿We'll sure miss you Elder Perry! ﻿Elder L. Tom Perry's final talk. Incredible final message to the Lord's 
children before the Lord called him back home. RIP L. Tom Perry.﻿Elder Perry died just a few minutes ago. I am so grateful the good Lord let 
his Apostle remind us of how important families and marriage are this past 
conference before He called Elder Perry to the other side to continue his 
ministry before the resurrection. ﻿Everywhere found on the Earth
Marriage and family matter
As the foundation of our birth
Our fondest dreams here gather﻿Marriage is still the ideal
As our hope for the future
For love that endures is real
And provides lasting nurture﻿Marriage and family
Is central to mankind
We live life happily
When all are well and mind


marriage and family-centered priorities cut across and superseded any 
political, economic, or religious differences. When it comes to love of 
spouse and hopes, worries, and dreams for children, we are all the same.﻿14:52 "Family is the center of life.  It is the key to eternal happiness."﻿
