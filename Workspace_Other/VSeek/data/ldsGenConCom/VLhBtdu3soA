fabulous talk! It's often difficult to keep an eternal perspective in daily 
life with some of the small and big things that go on around us, but when 
we are able to see the bigger picture, it is incredibly calming amidst the 
storm. Such a wonderful blessing to 'know the dealings of God'! Gracias
