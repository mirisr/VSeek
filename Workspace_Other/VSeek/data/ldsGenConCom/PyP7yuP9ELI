I'm so greatful for the apportunity to watched the church conference at 
home on my tablet. I only wish that they put the date on each session so 
that you don't keep going back to the same session that you've watched. 
Thank God for this church.﻿What a amazing spiritual feast this weekend never listened to all the 
sessions but this year i did and what a blessing it has been﻿good talks felt the spirt﻿
