Had this one for my baptism. Which was done in the Shoshone river Wyoming!﻿This song gives me goosebumps﻿I'm not LDS but I love this song.﻿Favorite hymn; the Mormon Tabernacle Choir version is amazing!﻿I'm personal glad to hear this hymn. It helps me think of good things like 
deacons quorum ﻿Millions will know Brother Joseph again......Amen to that!!﻿I have listened to this Hymns thousand times, still love it! Still my 
Favorite!﻿brilliant﻿Thank you to the Prophet Joseph Smith.  ﻿Loor al Profeta <3 Esta canción siempre llega a lo más profundo de mi 
corazón y de mi ser. I hope someday I´ll meet him personally and will have 
the honor to shake hands and give him the best hug to tell him how thankful 
I am for his life. Thanks so much for sharing!!! ﻿Despite all the controversy surrounding his name, Joseph Smith's blood was 
among the most precious martyrs blood to ever stain American soil.  The 
fruits of his sacrifices are among the greatest of all American 
contributions to the world.  The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is just one of 
many manifestations of this fact. ﻿Great song!﻿Is it normal have a little tear on my eyes while seeing this? (every time)﻿
