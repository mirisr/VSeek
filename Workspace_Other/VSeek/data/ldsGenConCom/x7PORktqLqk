I love this. It has happened to us and we found a Ward Family where we are 
loved and accepted. Sadly there are wards where the adversary gets a little 
chink in the works and keeps working here a little and there a little. Love 
one another is all it takes. Acceptance, approval. I can easily see how the 
commandment "Bearing of False Witness" is such a heavy one! Be kind, be 
thoughtful, be helpful, be filled with charity. It is easy. Yes stop 
it! Yes do it.﻿Love this video!!!﻿I watched what she said happen to a couple of wards. Satan destroyed them. 
Watch carefully for those who are wolves who actually work for satan. Then 
have the courage to correct or not participate or redirect the conversation 
when backbiting starts. Stop it! Also, backbiting is a direct violation of 
the priesthood and baptismal covenant. ﻿
