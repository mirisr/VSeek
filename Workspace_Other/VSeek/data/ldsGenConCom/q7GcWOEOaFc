I like how the father helped his 8 year old son when he wasn't sure about 
committing to being a full-time missionary in the future.

"He says"
Son. You know Jesus was a missionary he walked the streets like elder ?? 
And his companions and made people happy by teaching the commandments. 
"Wouldn't you like to be like Jesus"

"The boy then replies"
Yes father I would love to be like Jesus christ

Ahh I love the gospel :)ï»¿
