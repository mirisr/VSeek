Thank you very Elder Dallin H. Oaks your talk really is what I needed in 
this my moments of loneliness and sadness since the passing of my dear wife 
Malou just last September 23, 2015. I love her very much, I know that she 
is in a much better happier place right now, no more pain and difficulties 
of mortal infirmities. She now meet her beloved father Papa Rudy who was a 
very good man. I know I will met her again in the next life and then enjoy 
together in full happiness in the eternities in the highest degree of the 
Celestial kingdom. It made me to be more righteous everyday so that I can 
be with her again.﻿my soul feasting the word of God and I feel so delighted﻿the primary singing really made me feel the love <3﻿this talks made me cry i Love the Lord I want to follow Him and do what He
