Lord, we praise thy holy name;
In this sacred place of worship,
We thy glories loud proclaim!

Let her richest blessings flow
To the Saints who nobly serve thee
In the gospel here below.

By the prophets long foretold–
Where the children of the promise
Shall be gathered in the fold.

Alleluia, Alleluia,
Bright and clear our voices ring,
Singing songs of exultation
To our Maker, Lord, and King!
Singing songs of exultation,songs of exultation
To our Maker, Lord, and King!
Our King!﻿
