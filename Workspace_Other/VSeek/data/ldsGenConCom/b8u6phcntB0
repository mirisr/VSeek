What a great talk from President Monson this is one of my favorites. I 
believe very much in the word of wisdom and have chosen the use of herbs as 
medicine as well as food as recommended by Jesus Christ. And, I will stand 
on that principle, courageously, even if I do it alone.  I will stand by 
the U.S. Constitution, even if I do it alone.  I believe the Book of Mormon 
Geography was in this Land of Liberty the United States of America 
particularly all the Eastern half. That the hill Cumorah is in the Land of 
Cumorah upstate New York and that Zarahemla is located on opposite of 
Nauvoo, Illinois in Lee County, Iowa. I know this to be true from scripture 
D&C 125:3. That Bountiful was in Ohio, that the Earthworks and Mounds in 
Ohio and throughout America were built by the Jaredites and Nephites  That 
they did not build with hewn stone but with Wood and thus the remaining 
Earthworks and ditches and I will stand alone on theses truths until it 
becomes official. mwwï»¿
