About to give a sacrament talk about this awesome message :D﻿I am not LDS, but I love listening to the talks given by the General 
Authorities. This is quite possibly the best talk I have ever heard. This 
man needs to be elevated to a much higher position within the LDS Church. I 
believe he would really make the church relevant to people!﻿Dissonance is awful
We are prone to fight
The music of the gospel
Introduces light
Displace the darkness
And introduce light
Dissonance grows less
When we are Christ-like!﻿Awesome!﻿I really liked this talk. we were taking about having our own testimony in 
mission prep. and how we need to gain our own testimony, and know why we 
trust the Lord, because that is the only way we will really be an 
instrument in the Lords hands﻿
