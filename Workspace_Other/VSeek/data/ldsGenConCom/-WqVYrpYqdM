I am going thru a very difficult time right now in my life, or I should 
say, my family & I, are in a very low, difficult point in our lives. Our 
missionaries, asked me to listen to this talk, & clearly there was a 
purpose for it lol ﻿It's not easy stay in the boat sometimes because the temptations outside, 
but if we have the vision what can happen to us on the rivers of this 
world, we better stay safe and our families, preying and given thank our 
heavenly father for all the blessings we received!﻿
