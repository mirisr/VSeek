I am moved by this true message. Our loving heavenly Father loves us and is 
ever ready to bless as we choose aright. He will never force or compel. As 
we exercise faith we invite the Heavens to come to our aid in times of 
need. And in good times to deepen our joy.﻿heart touching, soul filling, hope giving. Thank you﻿#LDSconf﻿First comment!﻿
