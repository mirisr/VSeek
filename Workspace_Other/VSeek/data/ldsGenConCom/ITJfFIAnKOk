awesome!﻿Very clear in his statements!﻿I am not restricted by the commandments of God.  I still have the freedom 
to lie, steal, kill, or fornicate if I wish.  However, when I choose to 
live righteously, I exercise my faith in God that keeping his commandments 
will bring happiness.﻿Wow!. Man, what a good talk.﻿This was a great talk! I'm grateful to the Savior who helps relieve life's 
burdens and creates a positive interchange that makes me happier!﻿
