The talks really uplifted me so much!!!! Elder Uchtdorf still has me in 
tears...I feel the spirit so strong right now...I know my Heavenly Father 
loves me and I love him too!!! I love surfing him, and knowing when I walk 
in the temple that I have walked where he has!!!﻿I was in the choir and it was AMAZING!﻿
