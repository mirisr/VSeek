Beth, Mormon 8:35-40 is about the LDS church. Ask a Mormon which church is 
God's church and he will tell you this one. Yet that section of verses 
chastises his readers (understood to be a last days audience) "why have ye 
polluted the holy church of God?" He tells us we are full of malice, 
strife, envy, jealousy, and that we ignore the widows and orphans so we can 
look good. He says everyone does that except for a few humble followers of 
Christ. 

The key is, don't be what these verses accuse. ﻿So true. When I came back (after 13years) I would be crying at the back of 
the chapel when the hymns would start in sacrament, as i made my way back 
to full activity. I don't know how many times after sacrament I'd get to 
the car and cry this time in sorrow because no one would speak to me. So 
now, I PURPOSELY sit at the back with my 3 kids!! (I've been fully active 
for over 2 years) So any new face I see come in, I can greet them with a 
warm welcome and help them feel at ease being there :)﻿
