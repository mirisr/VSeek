First comment! :D I just wanted to say, it was amazing to be able to be 
there and witness the power of the spirit in that building, especially 
after those few "opposed". They sure got quite the spiritual slap in the 
face! It was an amazing experience, on top of being able to participate in 
the choir for that session. I will never forget this!!ï»¿
