Good Day . Will some one please upload the Priesthood Session as soon as it 
is broadcast later today. I am in South Africa and the timing difference 
does not allow to watch it live and byu tv schedule does not allow us to 
watch it tomorrow. I normally download the session from youtube if someone 
has uploaded it. Please help.﻿Thank you Elder Ballard﻿I find it odd seeing some guys looking like security facing the 
congregation.  Are they security?﻿thank you so much﻿Pwede na ba ibroadcast ang priesthood session sa youtube or other way of 
broadcasting...Before kase even sa LDS website audio lang walang video.. 
Just want to clarify.﻿The Church is true! Thanks for the upload.﻿thank you for uploading it.﻿
