No matter how many times I listen to these  talks  I feel the Spirit.  If 
you need a break from the world,  listen to these great  Conference talks, 
 they bring peace, and rest  to the soul.﻿Want to hear testimonies of Christ and messages to help us in these latter 
days? Partake of this General Conference message and have your life 
strengthened and changed. I have a goal every 6 months to review and review 
again each conference, especially in preparation for the next.﻿When are they going to address cesletter.com at conference?﻿I used to not understand why we needed prophets and apostles now i do. 
Before i could care less about general conference now i see its full of 
very important personal messages for us and love it.﻿Thanks Sister Reeves﻿
