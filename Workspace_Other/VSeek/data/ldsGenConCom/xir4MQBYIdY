I sincerely apologize!  This was muted for some reason, so I unmuted it.  
I'm blind, and I assumed that the video wasn't playing when in fact, it was 
muted for some reason.  Sigh!  Thank you.﻿Hello there.  Thank you for uploading this.  I'm sure you probably could 
play this before you uploaded ;this, but I've tried to play this twice now, 
and nothing plays.  Could you please check on this and fill me in?  I'd 
like to hear it.  Thank you very  much.﻿
