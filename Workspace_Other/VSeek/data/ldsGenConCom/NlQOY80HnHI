I'm confused!!!!!!!! It's my understanding that we don't follow the 
calendar God intended. God's calendar starts on the new moon, the first day 
being the Sabbath then followed by these dates, the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 
the 29th of every month falling on those same days. So how can it be 
possible to keep the Sabbath when the true Sabbath often fall in the middle 
of the week? ï»¿
