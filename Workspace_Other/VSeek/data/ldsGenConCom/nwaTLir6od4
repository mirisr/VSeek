IS IT I. I believe that everyone, as they bow their heads to receive 
sacrament should ask the question"Is it I?". What better time or place is 
there to feel the spirit and to ask God this very simple question. Pray 
then to ask forgiveness for things you feel you have done that week.﻿become like a child to become disciplined. ﻿
