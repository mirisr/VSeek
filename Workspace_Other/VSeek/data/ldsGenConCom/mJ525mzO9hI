I have realized a few years ago that I am not indestructible and life is 
short. I agree with the message herein and would follow this advice myself.﻿This talk was an answer to so many prayers on my part. I've been ingrained 
in these distractions for so long, however, that changing those habits is 
extremely difficult. It's something that must be accomplished though, and 
this talk helped me see that. I realize that Elder Cook probably will not 
see this message, but I wanted to say thank you anyways.﻿
