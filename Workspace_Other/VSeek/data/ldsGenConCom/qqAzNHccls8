Against all the detractors of the Church I have only a few words to say: 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. 

"The truth of God shall go forth". -﻿"But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I 
have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other 
gods, even that prophet shall die."  Deuteronomy 18:20﻿So grateful for the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Lord using him to restore 
the truth on earth.﻿
