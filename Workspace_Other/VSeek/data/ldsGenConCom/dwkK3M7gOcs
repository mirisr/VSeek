he got the Isaiah passage of scripture MEMORIZED...wow﻿"We don't know all the reasons why Jesus Christ went into the wilderness to 
fast and to pray, but we know at least one of the affects: The Savior 
resisted Satan's temptations to misuse His divine power"
That statement alone speaks volumes, evening having many different 
interpretations and ways to apply it to our individual lives.﻿There's SO much more in this talk than I remember there being when I first 
listened to it!﻿
