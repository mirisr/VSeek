It bothers me when I see people call him PROFIT as if to say he is a 
Prophet of The Lord to make money. This man is truly called of god and all 
the things that he speaks are things that he believes with all the 
sincerity of heart. It bothers me when people say that missionaries make 
false claims and tell you that it's fact. I am 15 and go out with the 
missionaries on a regular basis and alls they do is tell you what we 
believe and then invite you to pray about what they have taught. To anybody 
who might read this, this is the true gospel of Jesus Christ. We do have a 
loving father in Heaven who wants us to make it back to live with him 
again. I have been reminded numerous times that the Book of Mormon is the 
true word of god, and if you haven't read it, please for your sake do! If 
you do it with faith in the right intent, it will change your life.ï»¿
