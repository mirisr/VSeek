This song moves me!  God the Father testified of the divinity of His 
Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, on several occasions, as recorded in holy 
script.  As I search these sacred writings, the Holy Ghost testifies of 
these truths to ME!﻿I don't know why but I just feel an overwhelming peace when I hear this 
this song. Its like its saying Christ's mission was to go through 
everything for us. Anyways, I love it.﻿
