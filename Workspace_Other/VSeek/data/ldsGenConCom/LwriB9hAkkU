No matter how hard the way home may be
I have covenants that weekly renew.
The power of the atonement saves me
To go forth in faith to serve and do﻿It is in the witness
Of the spirit born
We know God is with us
And mourns with those who mourn﻿We lighten the load
Of others best
By helping the Lord
Strengthen and bless﻿Be the hands of the Lord
Assist those in need
Lighten loads, give comfort
He'll be there indeed﻿Hope, courage, and increased strength
Comes as we do our best
To nourish those in need of faith
The Spirit comes to bless﻿There's a reason
We care and give comfort
It is pleasing
To feel, inside, the Lord﻿Burdens in life 
Are made light
Through Jesus Christ
Who hears our cries﻿
