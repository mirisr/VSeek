Awesome.﻿Touching. Love the talks.﻿The first time I saw this (while paying attention), this sermon brought 
tears to my eyes. .﻿Wonderful!﻿I am so Thankful for my Heavenly Fathers gift to us and for our elder 
brothers being our savior and for inspired church leaders to teach us what 
love is all about.﻿This talk was given to me by sister missionaries. The power and conviction 
of this man have yet to be equaled in my eyes. Thank you.﻿Love it much! :')﻿After watching Elder Holland's sermon with an open mind and an open 
heart, one cannot help but be touched and think of heavenly, sacred things, 
particularly the endless love and devotion of the Savior of the world, 
Jesus Christ.﻿His talks are always amazing and hits me straight in the heart.👍﻿Incredible talk, life changing sermon on the Savior of the world. ﻿
