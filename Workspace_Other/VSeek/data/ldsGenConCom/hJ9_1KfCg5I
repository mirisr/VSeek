We love you President Thomas S. Monson. You are always in our hearts and 
our prayers.﻿I feel the same, he looked so frail, but enduring til the end﻿So influential and intriguing words!﻿Thanks predint Monson for a nice speach,it's reminds me to be an a good 
example and let my light so shine...Hope you reach the next conference next 
year..God will bless you for the strength...thanks for alots of good words 
you guide us everytime,and your kind example to us...﻿i feel a little sad i feel like this is the last general conference but i 
now he will be okay it was cool still having him as a prophet please now 
that he is a good guy we love you take care﻿My teacher is President Monson's son who teaches at BYU. One of my friends 
asked him how President Monson was. Apparently he has had diabetes for 
years and has basically no feeling in his feet. Standing for extended 
periods is difficult for him to do. He only does well on his feet for 5-10 
minutes at a time. So unfortunately this wasn't an isolated incident, 
rather it was just a sign of his advancing years. Dr. Monson's sister was 
in the congregation watching and was nervous as could be. Dr. Monson was at 
home just hoping his dad would hurry up his remarks or cut them short and 
get to the end of his talk so he could sit down. (And I personally have 
noticed that he seems to have struggled more since the passing of Sister 
Frances Monson.)
He might have to give his talks while sitting in his chair from now on.﻿A good and decent man who follows Christ, a true prophet>﻿I hate to see him like this but he has a powerful spirit!﻿I have had a rough day, and I was in a completely different mindset 
yesterday than I was today. I was open to doing anything the church is 
against, because I kept justifying my action with irrelevant reasons. To 
see the difference even in the comments on this youtube video to any other 
is as astonishing as it is heartwarming. some people would watch this video 
and comment on some negative worldly appearance, but everyone who hears 
heavenly fathers holy prophet is caring and encouraging to his condition, 
which truly is amazing. We truly do stand out as member of latter day 
saints and surrounding ourselves with the light of Jesus Christ, I love 
heavenly father and want to continue to follow his word.﻿the weight of age ways heavy on his shoulders.﻿It really does sadden me that this might be the last time where we will 
here him. But I know that he was called of God and fulfilled his duty here 
on earth. He is a strong man and has been through so much. He will be so 
happy once he can see his wife and other family.﻿I struggle to understand why those in attendance of this conference failed 
to see or to respond to the Prophet who was clearly very clearly struggling 
and about to pass out. why didnt anyone assist this church leader???????﻿With selfishness I say, I really hope this is not the last time we hear his 
loving testimony of the Gospel. With love I say, I hope he is not suffering 
with pains, and if he is, that his time on Earth is not much more because 
his loving wife is waiting with open arms for him to come home. He has 
served our Father in Heaven and the Savior valiantly and honorably. I know 
he is a true Prophet. I know the church is true. I am grateful for the 
Gospel, and the joy and knowledge it brings into our lives.﻿Why do people talk negative! about our Prophet President Monson! he's still 
living he's alive I hope Heavenly Father let's him live more years....﻿May our prayers continue to sustain him :)﻿I agree with everyone's positive messages. He is truly an inspiring man. 
Heavenly Father's angels watch over all of us . We may not always see them 
but they are definitely there. God bless everyone!﻿Amazing example of how we should live. The Prophet Thomas S. Monson is the 
perfect example of dedicating ourselves to God﻿We thank thee oh God for a prophet!﻿Somebody get this man a chair.﻿<3 President Monson﻿What a wonderful talk. I would encourage you to watch it again. Our 
Prophet, a man called of God, has asked us to be a light in a dark world, 
to serve, to ponder the scriptures, to lift one another. What an amazing 
message, that I will take to heart and try to improve in my life. 
#ThankYouPresidentMonson﻿💖﻿siento un profundo amor ppr nuestro profeta.﻿his grandson is in the bishopric in my ward Pres Monson you are awesome!﻿President Monson we love you we suppot you and we pray for you!﻿He truly is a prophet of The Lord. I felt God's power as he talked about 
being a light to the world. At times we forget who we are, and why we are 
here, let thy thoughts be full of purity to act well.﻿How inspiring it is to see a man of God wear himself out in the service of 
his Lord.﻿Nothing can sway me from two things:
1: this man is a true prophet of God 
2: the Lord sustains him in fulfilling his calling﻿Hurts to watch this, and yet I am so grateful for this man. God bless our 
prophet.﻿Even though his physical frame is weak, his powerful testimony echoes 
through eternity. This man is a spiritual giant, and I love him like a 
grandfather.﻿Man of God🙏﻿He is a great light!!We love him.Thank you Pres Monson.﻿Thanks for the conveying God's message on being a light to the world in 
word, conversation, charity, spirit, faith, and purity. We love you!﻿love you president Monson, 💓💓💓﻿God held him up, I am always amazed when I watch one of these Elderly 
leaders speaking, and I am sure they collapse any moment, but they always 
make it through to the last word. They still do all they can to stand up 
and testify of Christ.﻿He is real Prophet, He's a great example to me .. He is very strong .. I 
love him and we need to pray to support him in this time of difficult..﻿El presidente Monson ha sido un hombre valiente. Se sobrepone al agobio del 
peso de los años, y sin embargo, sé que seguirá siendo firme y valiente 
hasta el final. Será mi ejemplo de cómo vivir la doctrina de Cristo, hasta 
el final. Gracias por su ejemplo, presidente Monson﻿May our Heavenly Father continue to bless you our dear Prophet. We will 
continuously pray for you and for all our leaders worldwide. We love you 
very much President Monson 😊﻿If you love him, let the man rest, or enjoy his time with his family, his 
grandchildren.﻿Absolutely one of the kindness most gentle men this world will ever know. 
It was very difficult but inspiring to see the conviction of this man, our 
prophet. May he have many more days to teach us!﻿very nice﻿I LOVE THIS MAN!﻿President Monson is a very special man of God... Rather this is his last 
talk or not, he has given over 50 years of his life to service and nearly 
30 years in the First Presidency of LDS Church.... Thank you very much 
President Monson and Heavenly Father for allowing his wisdom to enlighten 
us.... Only Heavenly Father knows when he will be taken home and be 
reunited with his beloved wife.﻿An incredible example of sharing the Lord's words, promises, and love to us 
all and he will hold on as long as he can to deliver the Lord's message 
until his duty here is done and passed on to the next President that we may 
be able to follow. Prime example here, I'm sure this message here alone has 
influenced millions around the world to listen more closely to the 
importance of the plan... if those are uncertain of what the plan is, it is 
strongly encouraged to come to understand it, why it is so important that 
we may know our Heavenly Father and his Son through the teachings given... 
it will be worth it, it is a promise to us all. President Monson is truly a 
mouthpiece of God, and to hear him speak yesterday during this physical 
state is extremely powerful to me. I am so thankful for the wonderful 
conference we had this past weekend! Such love to us all on this Earth!﻿The camera didn't show it but elder Uctdorf was poised to catch him the 
entire time, and had to help him back to his seat.﻿💜﻿:'(﻿I got scared tbh but you got to admire his spiritual power to endure till 
the end.﻿Ele estava cansado, 13 min discursando e no final ja estava tao cansado que 
estava se apoiando no pulpito. Ele é muito comprometido com o evangelho. 
Prestem atenção em sua postura no inicio e no final do video.﻿May the Lord always bless him.﻿Prayers for the prophet.
.﻿Poor guy; the last 30 seconds he went downhill quick.﻿God bless the prophet Thomas S. Monson﻿I started bawling, listening to the last 30 seconds. I am saddened to think 
that this may be the last we hear from our Prophet. He is the only Prophet 
I have known in the church, as I am a convert... I love him SO much!!.... 
My heart is breaking.﻿He is awesome! President Monson you're my hero.﻿I think the power of this sermon matches or exceeds any other that has been 
delivered in this dispensation. His determination and selflessness is 
relentless and truly humbling. Shall we not go on in so great a cause with 
examples such as this?﻿let's pray!﻿Someone should've helped him at the end.﻿You have held us up
And lead us along
I know it's been tough
For there is much wrong
Thank you for each word
Your kind example
I felt and I heard
Pure love to sample!


The weight of his mantle
became apparent today. 
There's a lot to handle.
For our prophet we pray.﻿I'm so afraid this might have been the last time we here him speak :(﻿I fear this may be the last general conference in which we hear our prophet 
speak. He was struggling so much at the end of his talk there. God bless 
him for pushing through.﻿I admire this man﻿I love President Monson, the living prophet. He didn't look too good 
towards the end of his talk.﻿President Monson. ❤️﻿
