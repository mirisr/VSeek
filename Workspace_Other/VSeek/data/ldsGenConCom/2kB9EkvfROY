Conference is always outstanding. This Priesthood session is no exception. 
I especially enjoyed the opening hymn. Very powerful!﻿The messages in this semi annual general conference really helps me a lot 
to be strong and move on since the passing of my dear wife Malou last 
September 23, 2015. I know I will met her again in the next life to enjoy 
full happiness in the eternities in the highest degree of the Celestial 
kingdom.﻿wow that last song army of helaman had such power! amazing stuff gentlemen!﻿A great session﻿
