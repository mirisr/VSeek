where may I get dvds of this music?﻿I fully and totally agree with Savanah Cordray's comments. I have not ever 
listened to this marvellous choir without listening in awe of their 
quality. And, while I was never a Choristor, I was a professional musician 
for more than twenty years. Bravo!﻿This is beautiful﻿
