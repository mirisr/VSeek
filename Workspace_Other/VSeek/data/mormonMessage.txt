More about the unique the stories covered in the Meet the Mormons full movie:
 
Meet the Humanitarian - 
 
After leaving his village to receive a degree in Engineering, Bishnu Adhikari returned to his home in Nepal with a newfound faith and a determination to help improve the living conditions of the area. Bishnu now travels to remote villages in the Himalayan Mountains to build roads, schools and water systems, all while living with his faith and respecting his culture and his family’s expectations.
 
Meet the Coach - 
 
As Head Football Coach of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Ken Niumatalolo balances the pressures of his high-stress job by putting his family and faith first. In the competitive, high-stakes world of college football, he made the shocking decision to cancel staff meetings on Sundays, traditionally seen as critical to the team’s success, to instead honor the Sabbath day.
 
Meet the Fighter - 
 
With her husband’s help, extreme sports enthusiast Carolina Muñoz Marin has fought her way to the top of women’s amateur kickboxing in Costa Rica, challenging the traditional stereotypes of a Mormon woman. In between family time and training for competitions, Carolina and her husband run a charity to help those in Costa Rica who are less fortunate.
 
Meet the Bishop - 
 
Jermaine Sullivan works full-time as an academic counselor to 200 students in order to support his wife and three kids. He also volunteers full-time as a Bishop of a Mormon church in Atlanta, Georgia. He leads his diverse congregation with youthful exuberance while shattering stereotypes of what it means to be a Mormon Bishop.
 
Meet the Mom - 
 
Dawn Armstrong, a struggling single mother, had hit rock bottom and lost all hope. Then she met some Mormon missionaries who helped her and her son get back on their feet and start a new life. Her son is now older and ready to fulfill his two-year voluntary missionary work. As she helps him prepare to leave home for the first time ever, she also prepares to say goodbye.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Giving All for Refugees in Kurdistan**tgOBEGN62s0**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tgOBEGN62s0/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/give-back Dr. Nemam is a native of Kurdistan, a land torn apart by war. She was working in Sweden when she heard news that her people were suffering, so she decided to return and offer any help she could. What she came home to shocked her.

In one refugee camp, over 15,000 people were struggling to live healthy, happy lives. Dr. Nemam could give them basic health care, but she wanted to do more. She became a self-taught expert in baking bread for the masses. Today, she and her fellow volunteers provide bread twice daily for the refugees of the camp.

LDS Charities, of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also wanted to help. Most of the refugees Dr. Nemam serves come from a culture in which it is customary to wear special clothing. LDS Charities makes and delivers that clothing to the camp. Otherwise, the refugees wouldn’t have access to it.

“It’s very special for them. They feel after all the disaster—when there are many people who don’t care about them—when somebody comes… It’s a simple gift, but for them, it means a lot,” Dr. Nemam explains.

Tens of millions of refugees scatter the globe. There may be some in your community. Find out how you can help by visiting http://giveback.lds.org.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Reflections**uao5CImdnsE**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uao5CImdnsE/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**When trials and tests come, how do you react? Do you become selfish and scared, or do you face the challenges with patience, faith, and love for others? How you react could change your life and the lives of those around you, for better or worse.
 Elder James B. Martino taught, “In our trials, let us not become bitter or uncommitted, but let us follow the Savior’s example of becoming more earnest, more sincere, and more faithful. ... Let us not complain, … let us serve others, and let us forgive one another. As we do this, all things will work together for good to us that love God.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Unplanned Pregnancy, Adoption and the "Best Gift Ever"**z3g3IomqUzM**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z3g3IomqUzM/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/his-grace

When Katie became a single mother following an unplanned pregnancy, she couldn’t have imagined the impact her unplanned pregnancy and adoption story would have on her faith and others’. She allowed a family to adopt her infant daughter—a choice that was made with pure love in her heart. Her experience is a reminder that such love is available to everyone only through the grace of Jesus Christ.

“Through [His grace] I have been able to forgive myself of my mistakes and be happy now and really have hope for my future and for the future of my little girl,” Katie says. “It’s incredible.” Katie signed away her parental rights on Christmas Eve morning. She was faced with the trial of a lifetime, but she found strength through prayer and faith. 

“You can either become bitter or you can become better through God.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*One Big Experiment - Happy Families**7v4OjsrGwAY**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7v4OjsrGwAY/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**“Parenting is kind of like one big experiment: you’ve just got to try things and see how they work out, and hope they work out for the best,” says David Oh, father of the Oh family featured in this episode of Happy Families.
 
The Oh family prefers to work on their chemistry while literally working on chemistry. They create a dry ice solution that will freeze household objects like candy, bottles, and even flowers.
 
“We do it because it’s fun and cool. … It’s fun to experiment together and see what happens,” says mom Bryn Oh. “I would say parenting is kind of like working with dry ice. There’s a little bit of fear and apprehension. It’s a little bit messy. Sometimes you want to take it outside.”
 
David, Bryn, and their three children also enjoy inventing things, developing their talents, and playing games. The best part about each of those activities is that everyone can participate and cheer each other on.
 
“There’s really a great value to working together as a family to create something,” David says.
 
Discover what other families do for fun by watching the rest of the Happy Families series.

Scared and homeless, the refugees had nowhere to turn until two brothers gave up their houses so the displaced people could have a place to live.
 
Today, about 23 families live in those two houses. None of the refugees are employed and all are in need of basic necessities like food, clothing, and medical support.
 
“Seeing these children, women, and elderly all crying, seeing their situation—I just want to be there for them, to help them, to serve them in any way I can,” says a woman who takes care of the refugees.
 
LDS Charities partners with a network of credible agencies to provide food, shelter, and sanitation for refugees like these all around the world. What are you doing in your own community to help “the strangers in our midst?” Share your story and learn how to help at http://giveback.lds.org.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*What Should I Do When I See Pornography?**_x_ijWnjcOY**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_x_ijWnjcOY/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Many children will encounter some form of pornography prior to age 12. Some will go back to look at more. Parents or trusted adults can help prepare them so they know what to do when they see pornography. This video teaches children what pornography is, why it's harmful, and three simple action steps they can do when see pornography:

Call it what it is
Turn it off or turn away
Talk to a parent or trusted adult.
If children have gone back to look at more pornography, the principles in the video encourage them to get help right away. Children can also feel reassured that God loves them, that their parents love them, and that their parents will help.

We apologize for an error in our video. The end slate should state: “Special appreciation to Kristen A. Jenson and Dr. Gail Poyner, authors of Good Pictures Bad Pictures: Porn-Proofing Today's Young Kids ©, for their assistance in the development of some of the concepts found in this video.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Landscape of the Mind: Addiction Explained**XwYASU-YVcw**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XwYASU-YVcw/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://mormonchannel.org/12steps Dr. Kevin McCauley turns complex neuroscientific concepts into easy-to-understand visual images that will help people in recovery feel better understood and their families and friends feel hope that recovery is possible.
 
Addiction is never an escape from responsibility for our choices and our actions, but it does affect our brains like a disease that is difficult to control. Because addiction rewires the brain, the substances and behaviors we are addicted to may seem impossible to quit. However, there is hope; the brain can change.
 
“We find healing and relief only when we bring ourselves to the feet of the great physician: our Savior, Jesus Christ,” said Elder Patrick Kearon of the Quorum of the Seventy.
 
Share this video with friends and family members struggling with addiction to show your support and to help them find hope and healing.

This constant negative reinforcement allows addiction to continue. Talk to someone you trust who can help you stay accountable for the choices you make every day.

A part of the adult brain called the frontal lobe considers the risks and benefits before doing something. Because the frontal lobe is not fully formed until adulthood, teens’ reasoning abilities are not as strong. As a result, they are more vulnerable to addiction. Learn to recognize the signs of adolescent addiction and you might save a life.

Your brain is a control center that sends out powerful signals to the rest of your body to tell it what to do or how to feel. When you are addicted to a substance or behavior, your brain sends out unhealthy signals, making you believe that something harmful is okay because it makes you feel good for a time.

Before she completely lost hope, she sought help. To quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes was one thing, and to change her life-threatening eating habits was another. Because she confessed her problems to herself, to God, and to someone who could help, recovery was possible.

Step 5 - Confession: Admit to yourself, to your Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, to proper priesthood authority, and to another person the exact nature of your wrongs.

But when his addiction to sex and pornography hijacked his self-control, he found himself doing just that. David thought maybe he could simply get over his addiction without help from anyone. That is when he learned that confession is the first and vital step to recovery.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Always Something to Give – The Coconut Farmer**dSxSB-TELo0**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dSxSB-TELo0/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/give-back In November 2013, the strongest typhoon ever recorded slammed into the Philippines. The 20-foot storm surge was and 195 mile-per-hour winds caused many deaths. Those who survived had to rebuild their lives from the ground up. The opportunities to help each other along created a beautiful silver lining around an otherwise terrible tragedy.
 
One farmer found his coconut trees torn to the ground by the storm. The trees had provided the family’s only source of income, not to mention a special place to create memories and strengthen bonds. The farm wasn’t all that was lost; his house was gone as well, like most of the houses in the path of the storm.
 
“So we helped each other,” the farmer says. “Those who didn’t have a roof, we helped them to rebuild their roof. Our church started a program to rebuild houses. I tried to do what I can. I gathered our coconut trees and gave them away.”
 
The lumber from his fallen trees was given away for free to those who didn’t have money for construction supplies.
 
“Even though you may be going through trials, you can still help others because there is always something you can give,” the farmer testifies.

I see my mother kneeling with our family each day.
I hear the words she whispers as she bows her head to pray.
Her plea to the Father quiets all my fears.
And I am thankful love is spoken here.

Mine is a home where every hour is blessed by the strength of priesthood power.
With father and mother leading the way.
Teaching me how to trust and obey;
And the things they teach are crystal clear,
For love is spoken here.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Helping Refugees in Iraq – The Mayor of Howesk**2f0BsQqJmSg**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2f0BsQqJmSg/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/give-back 

ISIS chased more than one million people from their homes in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Militants swept through the city and the people were forced to flee for their lives. All they had were the clothes on their backs—no money, food, or cars. The one thing they could cling to was hope. Hope is what they found in a small refugee village in Kurdistan Iraq run by Mayor Murad Mardilos Wartanian.
 
At the time, the village was comprised of 115 families, living in 115 houses. Then 82 refugee families arrived. More and more homeless people came to the village. The mayor did not turn any of them away; instead, he welcomed them enthusiastically.
 
“We came here when we had no place to go to, and the people here did not abandon us. They provided everything we need,” says one refugee.
 
The mayor made room for them to live in the school and the main hall. He gave them beds, clothing, and food. Thanks to his generosity, they enjoy a feeling of safety that seemed gone forever.
 
“We are not perfect, but we love helping others, because we know this is an emergency, and people in hard situations should show who they really are and be good to one another,” says the mayor.
 
LDS Charities provides food and commodities for refugees in this village and other places around the world. To find out how you can give back, visit  giveback.lds.org.

Whether your children are grown or still growing, opportunities to teach them truth will never run out. That fact is brought to life in this sweet and simple story of a dad doing his best to set an example of service, love, and prayer for his young boys. It is a perfect reminder that true success comes to parents who don’t let distractions—no matter how worthwhile—get in the way of living basic gospel principles and teaching their children to do the same.

Paul teaches the Saints they are the temple of God.

1 Corinthians 3:14-17

14 If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

15 If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

Maylene has endured many storms in her life, but it was in the wake of the 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado that she found the strength to truly rebuild her faith.

The day of the tornado, Maylene was ready to give up on a life that had completely overwhelmed her. Her second husband had left her to raise their children alone and she was working three jobs to keep the family afloat. She felt helpless. But after surviving the tornado that day, Maylene knew that she and her family could make it through anything with God’s help.

“My whole life, I’d felt abandoned. Like there were pieces missing. After the storm, God answered my prayers. He picked up the pieces and filled that void. I don’t ever have to feel like I’m going to be alone or abandoned again because He’s going to be there for me every step of the way.”

The Philippines is the 12th most-populated country in the world and is made up of over 7,000 small islands. Providing so many people with vaccinations for deadly diseases like measles seems like an impossible task. That doesn’t stop Gaylene from doing her part in her community. In fact, it motivates her to help as much as she can.

Vaccinations were reaching fewer and fewer children over time, causing measles outbreaks. Something had to be done. Gaylene volunteers with local youth groups to inform communities of the immunization drive.
She also volunteers her professional skills as a nurse at a hospital where the staff is small.

“I want to care for those people who are sick—especially the needy and the poor. Most of the Filipinos don’t have enough money for health services,” she explains.

An estimated 1.5 million children die every year of vaccine-preventable diseases. You can help them get what they need. Visit giveback.lds.org to find out how.

“It makes me a whole being. It makes become a better person,” Gaylene says. “I know that at the end, it is something you can say that at least you have done something for them. It softens my heart. It really softens my heart.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints*NewVideo*Making a Difference to Orphans with HIV**RehlLkq64x0**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RehlLkq64x0/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/give-back/making-a-difference-to-orphans-with-hiv

The number of poor, sickly orphans in Romania grew uncontrollably in the 1980s. The children received blood transfusions to make them stronger—no one knew that the blood was infected with HIV. Through the use of a single syringe, the virus was passed along from one child to another.

Mary, an American social worker, decided to spend a year in Romania doing something to help. One of her earliest jobs was sitting with the children as they died.

“I said, ‘I can’t do this.’ But it’s amazing what you can do when you have to do it,” she explains.

The situation seemed hopeless. Then, antiretroviral drugs were sent to Romania. The drugs can significantly increase length and quality of life for HIV patients. Suddenly, there was hope.

“I’ve always—all of my life—had a very strong feeling that we were put here to do something good for other people. I don’t know exactly how I ended up here, when I look back on it, or how I’ve managed to stay this long. But I feel incredibly privileged that I’ve been able to do so. I lead such an enriched lifestyle.”

You can help in your own way. Learn how at http://giveback.lds.org.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints*NewVideo*Lift: The Power of Service**YAuqdPWTGLI**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YAuqdPWTGLI/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/mormon-messages/lift-the-power-of-service

“What if your neighbor asked you to take 20 minutes one night to help him? Would you do it? Most decent people would. But what if he asked you every night following, with no end in sight? Would you be willing to do it? … When would serving your neighbor feel more like servitude?”

That is the question a group of men had to ask themselves when they united to serve their neighbor Kathy, who suffers from the debilitating effects of multiple sclerosis. For the past seven years they have lifted Kathy into bed at night. In doing so they have lifted her spirit, as well as their own.

Kathy was diagnosed after 16 years of marriage. She assumed her husband would face the challenge with her. He decided he could not and filed for divorce. When her sons grew up, they had to come to her house every night and morning to help her in and out of bed. The work became too much for them to do alone.

A group of 50 men—friends, neighbors, and church members—offered to help. Every night, two of them come to get the bedtime routine rolling. They pull off her slippers, adjust her pillows, charge her wheelchair, and place pills on the nightstand. Then they lift her into bed. At first, the men felt awkward about the procedure and burdened by the responsibility.

“I felt sympathetic to the situation, but I felt like ‘You know, I’ve got other things I need to deal with,’” one explains.

The group discussed how they could help Kathy without having to visit her every night. One of the men said that if the others didn’t want to help, he would do it himself if he had to. That caused a change in attitude among the group. Kathy’s heart has also been touched and changed as a result of the service.

“I have seen an even greater compassion. It’s let me know that I’m not forgotten, that I’m still valued, not only to God, but I have worth to give other people in different ways,” she says.

Watch on the Mormon Channel: 

In the unique new documentary series Two Brothers Two, director Rick Stevenson takes us on a 10-year journey through the lives of the Nelson brothers, Sam, Luke, Tommy, and Joseph, as they struggle to find love for each other and for themselves.

In this episode, we get a glimpse into the brothers’ high school years, which provide them with unexpected opportunities to strengthen their bond. We also learn that Sam suffered from depression in his adolescence, probably contributing to the tension between he and Luke, who was completely unaware of Sam’s struggle. 17-year-old Sam has gained control of his depression and proudly reveals that he and 15-year-old Luke have not fought for an entire year.

“I would say without a doubt he is my best friend,” Luke says with a smile.

What is up next for the brothers? Find out with us in Episode 3.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Life after War and Overcoming Post-Traumatic Stress - His Grace**UeLyz1_Zzqw**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UeLyz1_Zzqw/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/his-grace/

The Taylor brothers have always been close, but enduring war, post-traumatic stress, and heroin addiction together brought them closer to each other and closer to Jesus Christ than they ever imagined possible.
 
“Growing up, we were involved in everything together,” says Chris, Mitch’s older brother. “He pretty much followed me everywhere I went, and he kind of mirrored all of the stuff that I was doing, for good or for bad.”
 
After Chris decided to serve in the army, Mitch did too. When Chris returned from Afghanistan and Mitch returned from Iraq, they both suffered from post-traumatic stress and became closed off, emotionally, physically, and spiritually.
 
Chris self-medicated with OxyContin prescribed to him for a back injury. Then he turned to heroin. Mitch began using as well, eventually becoming homeless. They hid each other’s addictions.
 
It wasn’t until Chris was hospitalized for complications with heroin that he decided to submit his will to Jesus Christ. When he did, he felt overwhelming peace and comfort.
 
“He knew what I was going through, and He put His arms around me and lifted my soul. And he took those burdens away from me, almost immediately,” he says.
 
When Mitch saw his brother begin to change, he realized he had to do something to change too. Like his brother, Mitch couldn’t recover until he turned to Christ.
 
“I felt like I was in this thing alone my whole life, but I wasn’t. … He cares for me, even when I can’t care for myself. In a world where everything is so dark and everything makes you feel like you’re alone, that’s been my anchor. … The Savior literally saved my life.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Helping Newborns in Sierra Leone**eXYIAQg0UGE**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eXYIAQg0UGE/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/give-back/

War devastated Sierra Leone for over 10 years. Rebels were killing civilians, civilians who weren’t killed had no food, and the road to freedom was blocked. Survivors Abie and Mohammad Turay are proof that God lives and loves His children.
 
Abie and Mohammad fled from their home and into the bush with their family and other members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They walked 18 miles and survived for several weeks. By the grace of God, they were not found and killed.
 
The Church provided the people of Sierra Leone with as many items of food, hygiene kits, and used clothing as they could gather. Abie still has the blanket the Church gave her that she used to warm her children and protect them from the mosquitos when they were in the bush.
 Now, the blanket is ragged and spotted with holes, but Abie shows it to anyone who visits her home. The blanket is a symbol that “I’m not finished. I’m still alive.”
 “That faith, that belief, that hope was within us. Why? Because of this humanitarian gesture that was afforded us,” she says. “We thank the Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints. We thank those people who provided that. May God bless them, wherever they are.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints*NewVideo*Pizza with the Puentes - Happy Families**Tca4TGfOo10**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Tca4TGfOo10/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/happy-families

For Ian and Melissa Puente, family time is always a busy time, thanks to their two sets of twin boys. Julian and Caleb are 7 years old, and Jack and Christian are 5 years old. All together, they make one happy family.
 
“It’s quite a zoo at times, but we really enjoy it,” says Ian.
 
The Puentes have learned to channel the energy of their home into family chores and activities that are both fun and productive. One of their favorite activities is pizza making in their backyard. With their giant brick pizza oven, the crew cooks up pies that look as good as they taste.
 
“Making pizzas works for us because we can all be together in one place. It’s a really simple thing to make and we get to talk and connect,” explains Melissa.
 
Pizza making allows the boys to use their creativity, which Ian encourages. In the end, it is all about the love.
 
“The home can very easily become a place that is just full of expectations for children. But I think for kids, it’s also very important to know that they can have fun here, that they can be themselves here,” he says.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Raising a Family: Learning the Ropes Together - Happy Families**1LZM497agrA**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1LZM497agrA/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/happy-families/raising-a-family-learning-the-ropes-together

Meet the Lewis family! If their talent for trick roping together does not impress you, we think their love and respect for each other will.

Christy, Jay, and their four kids are experts at all sorts of interesting things, but they know their success outside of the home is actually the result of success within the home. The Lewises have found that strong family bonds are the foundation for everything else.

“When Jay and I were first married, we both knew that we wanted to be very involved in our children’s lives,” explains Christy.

Jay and Christy teach their kids that hard work and hard play go hand in hand. Each of their family members cooperates to complete chores and help the others. When the work is done, they celebrate. No matter what they are doing, spending time together is the part that makes it fun.

“Some people say it’s quality [of time] and not quantity—to some degree it is quantity too. So hopefully we’re doing a decent job at both,” Christy says with a laugh.

How does your family spend time together? See what other families do to be happy.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*What Family Means - Happy Families**tL8u-6rkk5c**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tL8u-6rkk5c/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/happy-families/what-family-means

The Davies bring new meaning to the phrase “one big, happy family.” With seven kids, Jim and Becky Davies’ family is bigger than they had dreamed it could be. And it is clear that the group is happy. Most importantly, though, their love makes them one with each other in a way that tops any other factors—including DNA.

Jim and Becky struggled with infertility. Miraculously, their two eldest kids, Rachel and Jake, were born to them biologically. The blessings didn’t stop there. With the help of a private adoption agency and family, the Davies were blessed to welcome Jess, Kristin, Trevor, and Josh into their home and hearts over the course of several years. They were happily surprised when Becky then became pregnant with their youngest, Natalie.

The Davies don’t mind if others wonder how or why their family structure works. They are simply happy to be together.

“This is my family. I know that they will love me for who I am, and as well have the expectation that I’ll love them for who they are,” says Josh.

Jess feels the same way.

“It’s such an interesting group of people to have as a family,” she says, “but there’s just no question of us being meant to be together.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Blending Families: Love is Key - Happy Families**GKFe852b-50**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GKFe852b-50/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/happy-families

Love is the key—that is the motto the Goodjohn family lives by. Whether they are at home or at the park, you can bet that Nandi, Troy, and his daughter Dior are doing their best to show each other how much they care.
 
Nandi has two kids from a previous relationship who live in South Africa. She and Troy take care of Troy’s 8-year-old daughter, Dior, who spends every other week living with her mom.
 “It’s not easy for families to blend together. There are always complications,” Troy says.
 
Though successfully blending families can be tricky, the Goodjohn’s try to keep life simple when they are together. They turn even ordinary activities into opportunities to laugh and grow.
 “We don’t have an agenda. The flexibility makes things fun,” Troy explains. “If we have too many things on the schedule and things are too rigid then it’s not fun.”

 No matter where they are or what they are doing, the Goodjohns’ favorite part of being together is the sense of safety and happiness it brings.
 “When we’re together, it feels like a sense of completion,” Nandi says.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Bearing Our Burdens with Hope**aoe1-YXuuKU**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aoe1-YXuuKU/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/mormon-messages

Being happy does not always mean being without hardship. Sometimes it means just the opposite. That principle is brought to life in this story of a young husband who is only able to make it home safely after his load grows much heavier.

Elder David A. Bednar told the story in his general conference address “Bear Up Their Burdens with Ease.” A man became stranded in the mountains when his truck got stuck in the snow. It was only after he filled the truck bed with wood that he was able to escape.

“It was the load of wood that provided the traction necessary for him to get out of the snow, to get back on the road, and to move forward,” Elder Bednar explains.

When we face large or small challenges in life, we can take comfort in the truth that such experiences will build our strength and bring us closer to God.

“Sometimes we mistakenly may believe that happiness is the absence of a load. But bearing a load is a necessary and essential part of the plan of happiness,” Elder Bednar says.

I'm trying to love my neighbor;
I'm learning to serve my friends.
I watch for the day of gladness when Jesus will come again.
I try to remember the lessons he taught.
Then the Holy Spirit enters into my thoughts, saying:

""Love one another as Jesus loves you.
Try to show kindness in all that you do.
Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought,
For these are the things Jesus taught.""

I'm trying to be like Jesus;
I'm following in his ways.
I'm trying to love as he did, in all that I do and say.
At times I am tempted to make a wrong choice,
But I try to listen as the still small voice whispers,

""Love one another as Jesus loves you.
Try to show kindness in all that you do.
Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought,
For these are the things Jesus taught.""

""Love one another as Jesus loves you.
Try to show kindness in all that you do.
Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought,
For these are the things Jesus taught.""

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Prescription Drugs, Addiction, and Hope for Change - His Grace**kMaTauiidKQ**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kMaTauiidKQ/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/his-grace

Jordan Hansen started using pain medication for recreation when he and his friends were in school. At that point, he could not have imagined the way something seemingly harmless would quickly take control of his life. He also could not have imagined the kind of help and forgiveness Jesus Christ would offer him when he was ready to break free.

At first, using pain pills was a social experience for Jordan. As his addiction grew, it became a secret experience. He needed the pills to function, and he was willing to do anything to get them.

“Pretend you’ve got the worst hunger you’ve ever had in your life, and that hunger is never subsided—there’s nothing you can take or do to get rid of that, except one thing,” he says.

After one particularly large dose of Oxycontin, Jordan knew his life was in immediate danger. This thought came to him: “Any further down this path, you are going to be leaving your wife and your daughter here on this earth alone.”

He knew he could not change without help. His wife, doctor, and religious leader supported his decision to join an addiction recovery program. It was there that he felt the grace of Jesus Christ, the key to his recovery.

“To say it’s easy and to say it’s magic or it just disappears is not realistic,” he says. “But I certainly felt an extra help—a help from somewhere that was beyond me, that I wasn’t controlling.”

Jordan experienced Jesus Christ’s power to heal and lift anyone who chooses to turn to Him in their times of need.

When she lost her baby boy to a preventable disease, Helen knew she had to do something to save others from similar tragedy.

Her son was killed by an outbreak of German measles that spread through the children in her Filipino community. Now, she raises awareness as part of an immunization program that helps parents and children protect themselves from the disease.

“It was very painful for me as a parent, so whenever a child gets sick with the measles, I remember what happened, and I help them,” she says.

Helen’s friend Peachy introduced her to the program, which allows her to help others the way she wishes she could have been helped years ago.

“We feel that it is our obligation not to allow anyone to die or get sick of vaccine-preventable diseases. It is a fight of the whole country. It is a fight wherein we need every partner,” says Dr. Janet Garin, deputy minister of the Department of Health.

Meet the Pereira family. They love soccer, animals, and making bread because each of those things brings them closer together. Find out how in this episode of Happy Families.

Tanya Pereira grew up in Goa, India, where she raised chickens as a little girl. She shares a taste of her own childhood with her daughter, Kayla, who also has chickens.

“I wanted to give my daughter the same experience I had when I was growing up, and she absolutely loves them,” Tanya says.

The Pereira’s son, Nick, enjoys playing soccer—almost as much as his parents and sister enjoy cheering for him from the sidelines.

“What’s amazing is how the whole family has rallied around the whole soccer thing—including Mom. Mom is the loudest person we have,” says Nick’s dad, Neville.

When everyone is home after a busy day, the family can spend time making one of their favorite foods. Chapati is unleavened flatbread, a staple food in India. Tanya and Neville learned how to make it when they were young. Now, they pass the tradition and technique on to their children.

No matter the activity, the Pereiras have found that if it brings them together then it is always worth making time for.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Obedience to The Ten Commandments**nNzTTdD33Vg**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nNzTTdD33Vg/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos

Sin will always be sin. Disobedience to the Lord’s commandments will always deprive us of His blessings. The world changes constantly and dramatically, but God, His commandments, and promised blessings do not change. They are immutable and unchanging,” says Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

As children of God, we have been given the wonderful gift of choice. The truest happiness and peace we can have comes by choosing to obey His laws.

Those laws include never murdering, stealing, or lying. But what are His other commandments? The world has forgotten them. Have you?

1. “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3).

2. “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image” (Exodus 20:4). 

3. “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain” (Exodus 20:7).

4. “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8).

5. “Honour thy father and thy mother” (Exodus 20:12). 

6. “Thou shalt not kill” (Exodus 20:13).

7. “Thou shalt not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:14). 

8. “Thou shalt not steal” (Exodus 20:15). 

9. “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour” (Exodus 20:16). 

10. “Thou shalt not covet” (Exodus 20:17).

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Pornography Addiction: Is There Hope? - His Grace**lJh7lbgM3KY**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lJh7lbgM3KY/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/his-grace


Elizabeth was only 11 years old when she first came across pornography. That encounter sparked a long struggle with addiction, fear, and hopelessness. It was only when she believed in Jesus Christ’s power and desire to heal her that she felt miraculous hope.

Though she spent years suffering from addiction to pornography, she never told anyone.

“I was angry all the time at my family. They didn’t know why,” she says. “Sometimes I felt like they didn’t really know me, and if they did that they wouldn’t love me.”

She secretly researched information on dealing with her addiction, but found that most of it was geared toward men.

“It just made me feel more alone. ‘Am I the only woman struggling with this?’” she wondered.

People of all genders, ages, and faiths are currently drowning in the debilitating effects of pornography addiction. Elizabeth’s personal experience is a reminder that no matter how lost in darkness one feels, hope and light are available to anyone who chooses to believe in Jesus Christ.

In the 1980s, countless Romanian orphans were infected with the HIV virus through blood transfusions, vaccinations, and immunizations in hospitals. Dan was one of those orphans. Now a grown man, he was the only survivor among his friends.

“We made a family,” he says. “Unfortunately, all are gone, and I was left alone.”

Since 2000, Ana Filip, social worker who helps HIV-positive patients, has been working at the hospital where Dan was treated. The children became attached to her. At first, she knew so little about the virus that she was afraid to get close to them.

“In time we began to become friends, to take each other by the hand, to play, to learn, to draw together,” she says.

When Dan was 18 years old, he moved out of the hospital, but he continues to return regularly to take care of other patients.

“Dan, for us, is an example of a fighter,” Ana says. “The story of his life starts with a tragedy—to be infected without blame and to be condemned by society. … He is an inspiration to all of us.”

Though he is a hero to some, Dan is humble about his service.

The disciples' faith is tested before Jesus calms the stormy sea.

Mark 4 :37-40

37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?
39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?

Too many cooks in the kitchen? That is never a problem for the Chavez family. In fact, making a delicious meal elbow-to-elbow is their favorite way to spend time together.

“There [are] times when I think, ‘Oh, I feel claustrophobic,’ and then I stop myself,” says Conni, a single mom of four. “It’s not about convenience or speed or cleanliness. This is what matters.”

Conni’s kids started cooking with her when they were little. Instead of asking them to wait for her attention until she was done, she invited them to participate. They perfected tasty recipes including cheese sauce, guacamole, and lasagna.

“When they were younger, I never could have imagined the miracle this would produce. It’s kind of like the glue that held everything together,” she says.

As a single mom, sometimes Conni felt empty and as though her plan for life had been derailed. She found comfort and support in the time she spent with her kids, whether they were jumping on the trampoline, riding bikes, or cooking.

“These experiences with my kids would be the things that would fill me up,” she says. “It’s something sweeter than I could have ever imagined.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Family History: What I Found**_d4Mhl_kZYk**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_d4Mhl_kZYk/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/mormon-messages

Joe always loved his grandfather, but he didn’t know some of the most interesting things about him until a mysterious journal entry and a surprising wartime keepsake inspired Joe to learn more.

His grandfather was born 1912 in a tiny North Dakota town. He was a skilled piano player. He loved God, his country, his family, and learning.

“I knew my grandpa as a funny, kind, piano-playing man who always had a toothpick in his mouth and a dozen more in his shirt pocket,” Joe says.

After both of his grandparents passed away, Joe found a photo of them in which his grandfather was holding a pistol. The gun caught Joe’s eye, and his curiosity led him to discover details of his grandfather’s life as a soldier that he never would have known otherwise.

“The more I read, the more I was caught up, overwhelmed with emotion for what my grandfather must have seen and experienced. I had no idea.”

Joe still does not know the story behind the gun, but the connection he felt to his grandfather as he searched for answers is a better treasure than he hoped for.

“I am grateful to know him better—for the chance to strengthen our relationship even after he had passed on.”

For Bubba Palmore, growing up was rough. His father was murdered, his stepfather was abusive, and his friends lived a dangerous lifestyle. In spite of it all, he found the path to a life of light and joy through Jesus Christ. 

Before he found hope, Bubba struggled with drugs, alcohol, and even suicidal thoughts. 

“I felt like the world was closing in on me. … I couldn’t see the light. It was just dark. … No one knew the depth of my hurt other than me.” 

After running away from his broken home, he met a family that changed his life. He learned what it meant to feel love, kindness, and compassion. 

“I sought to know, ‘What is it that makes you guys so loving, so different?’ They explained to me that it was Jesus Christ.” 

Bubba’s story is a beautiful reminder that no matter how far you are from happiness, His grace has the power to lead you back."

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*The Power of Prosthetics and Giving: My Life Changed from Night to Day**2Z3IWtciqoo**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Z3IWtciqoo/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/give-back/the-power-of-prosthetics-my-life-changed-from-night-to-day

A tragic accident cost Mayerlinth Reyes her legs and changed her life forever. Fortunately, she found hope for a better quality of life, thanks to those who donated prosthetics to the people of Santa Domingo.

“From that moment, my life changed from night to day,” she says. “I can take my children to school, clean and wash my clothes. I feel that I can do anything. I feel so happy to have my prosthetics because I can live a normal life.”

Mayerlinth is not alone in her struggle. Many Dominican Republic citizens live as amputees who could be productive but are isolated in their homes.

“Here in Santa Domingo, they don’t take people in wheelchairs into account. There are no ramps. Buses will not stop for me. In most place I can’t go into a bathroom because the doors are too narrow.”

Mayerlinth’s doctor says he feels touched to give patients something they lost. To find ways you can give back, visit giveback.lds.org. Tell us how you have given back in your own community or around the world by commenting below or using the hashtag #IGiveBack.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints*NewVideo*Parables of Jesus: Parable of the Sower**MRehBbBTxbQ**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MRehBbBTxbQ/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos

Jesus explains why he teaches with parables and gives the parable of the sower to a multitude gathered on the seashore.

Matthew 13:1-23

1 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
3 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
4 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:
5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:
6 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:
8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.
9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?
11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.
13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
15 For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.
18 ¶Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;
21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

“I think being a mom is the most important job in the world—and I’m not joking,” says mother Claire Kenny, whose big family stars in the first episode of Mormon Channel’s brand new series, “Happy Families.”

In the video, we get a glimpse of a day in the life of the Kenny family. With six kids under the age of 12, mornings are a busy time in their home, but Claire has a few tricks for keeping the chaos in check. First, while everyone eats breakfast, she reads aloud from a children’s magazine.

“It’s a great way to start our morning with a nice quiet moment,” she says. “Their mouths are full of food, so they can’t talk back.”

Then everybody tackles their daily chores, which include getting dressed, making beds and cleaning up. Reminders they call “tags” hang on the wall to let the kids know what is left to accomplish. Though her kids don’t always work as quickly as she would prefer, Claire finds humor and happiness in their efforts.

“It’s great. They crack me up. And they also infuriate me sometimes,” she says with a laugh.

When everyone has made it out the door and into the car, it is time for a Kenny family tradition. Claire leads her kids in singing the song “Make it a Good Day” on the way to school. The lyrics are simple and sweet, and they hold valuable lessons.

Make it a good day
Make this one glow
Fill it with learning
There’s much to know
Make it a good day
Look in your heart
Build on your heritage
And do your part

It’s easy to see that this is a happy family, but Claire says it is a challenge to keep up sometimes.

“That is a hard thing—feeling a little stretched thin in my abilities to take care of everyone at the same time … and hoping that … I’m doing a good enough job in all of those areas,” she says.

“I look around me and I see so many of my friends. Their kids are dressed so nicely, and I’m coming with my kids, like, ‘Whatever, they picked out their own clothes.’”

Regardless, she knows that no matter what the day brings, they can make it a good one if they work together.

“The compounding effect of daily disciplines, with purpose and real intent, can make a big difference in all areas of your life,” said Brother Randall L. Ridd, second counselor in the Young Men general presidency, during the first Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults. “It can mean the difference between struggling through an ordinary life or being immensely successful and filling the measure of your creation.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Protect Our Nestlings - Keeping our Families Safe**3Vm9P4NlgkU**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Vm9P4NlgkU/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/mormon-messages/protect-our-nestlings

Is your family protected? That is the important question President Packer helps us consider in this story of looking out for those you love.

President Packer tells of a tragic scene he witnessed in his own backyard, where house finches made nests in the ivy. One day, he heard a group of finches cry out in alarm and saw a snake sliding out from behind the leaves. He knew the bulges in the snake’s body must have been baby finches taken from their nests

“Not in the 50 years we had lived in our home had we seen anything like that,” President Packer says.

His story illustrates the reality that even in our own homes we are vulnerable to the attacks of the adversary. It is vital that we take the necessary precautions to warn and protect our family members, especially children and teenagers.

As President Packer reminds us, “You will do no greater eternal work than within the walls of your own home.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Finding Your Purpose in Life: Does Faith Matter? – His Grace**oAaa135NnAY**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oAaa135NnAY/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/his-grace/finding-your-purpose-in-life-does-faith-matter

Have you ever wondered if God and Jesus Christ are really there? You are not alone. Rich Millar grew up believing completely in the reality and importance of the gospel. Prayer, scripture study, and service were his way of life. But that changed.

“Losing the faith that I had always had was a slow process,” he says. “You don’t realize what you’ve lost until much further down the road.” 

What’s the purpose of life? Was God’s love real? Was God Himself real? Rich asked all of these questions. The problems of the world only confused him more. 

“Because of all this pain and suffering that exists, maybe that means God doesn’t exist,” he thought. Rich left his faith behind to search for another kind of truth. He was surprised by what he found. 

“No matter how illogical it may sound, there is a God—an all-powerful, all-knowing God.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Food Storage: How to Start Your Emergency Food Supply**j_VglSdE0T4**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j_VglSdE0T4/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/blog/post/how-to-begin-a-3-12-month-food-supply

Food storage is more than just preparation for natural disasters. Many end up using it during smaller life disruptions. These could include periods of unemployment or underemployment, taking an unpaid internship for work experience, an unusually expensive booklist for school, or an unexpected car expense. Life is full of unforeseen challenges, especially when it includes frequent transitions.

Since buying food can take up a substantial part of your budget, preparing for challenges today will help you be better off when challenges arise. For instance, if you already have a supply of food in the cupboard, that’s one less expense you have to deal with when an unanticipated expenditure comes up. Food storage can allow for more economic security and independence.

In an animated world full of holiday cheer and excitement, each character encounters the light of Christmas. Lexi reminds us of the true source of that light by singing the story of the “The First Noel,” when an angel of God appeared to shepherds in a field to share the news of Jesus Christ’s birth. That message is embodied in a scene depicting the Nativity, where baby Jesus is in the center of it all.
 
How will you keep the Light of Christ in your heart and mind this Christmas? We hope this music video will help.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Water Well in Sierra Leone - “We received a miracle, it was a well!"**U1aflkH8T7U**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U1aflkH8T7U/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://mormonchannel.org/give-back

Sierra Leone is in the midst of a water crisis. Throughout Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa, you will find many who are still drinking water from unclean and polluted rivers. Listen to this Sierra Leonean woman tell her story of water crisis. She says, “Long ago our river was clean. Today it is dirty and full of sickness—malaria, cholera, and fever. My little Susan almost died from diarrhea. Our family was all affected by the dirty water. But we needed it; we all need water. We knew there was a problem. We saw the problem. But we are a poor village and could do nothing to change it. I was sad and afraid of losing a child. Then, last year, we received a miracle. It was a well! We were given the supplies and also the guidance, but the men of my village built it. They built it for our family—for all the families!” 

Now this Sierra Leonean village has clean, healthy water from a well they were able to build. But many more are still in need of clean water. One in eight people worldwide don’t have access to clean water. Share and comment ways you have been giving back in your own community or around the world using the hashtag #igiveback.

In this classic story by Leo Tolstoy, a humble old shoemaker discovers that by helping those around him, he is really serving the Savior.

One night, the Savior told Martin to look for him on the street the next day. Martin watched for the Savior, but instead saw three people who were each in need of something he could give.

Though he was disappointed that he had not seen the Savior, Martin soon realized that he had seen the Savior in the faces of the people he helped, and that by serving them, he had served Jesus Christ.

This Christmas, look for ways you can show love to the Savior, Jesus Christ, by serving those in need.

The Savior was know for teaching in parables. In this video, Jesus gives the parable of the laborers in the Vineyard.

Matthew 20: 1-16

1. For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
2. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
3. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
4. And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
5. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
6. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
7. They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.
8. So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
9. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
10. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
11. And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
12. Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.
13. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
14. Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.
15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
16. So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.

The Savior was know for teaching in parables. In this video, Jesus teaches a crowd of people about the parable of the wheat and the tares.

Matthew 13: 36-43

36. Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
37. He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
38. The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
39. The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
40. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
41. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
42. And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
43. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

Jesus Christ shows himself to his diciples at the sea of Tiberias and implores Peter to "feed my sheep"

John 21: 1-22

1 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. 
2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples. 
3 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. 
4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 
5 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. 
6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. 
7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. 
8 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes. 
9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. 
11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken. 
12 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 
13 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. 
14 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. 
15 ¶So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. 
16 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep. 
17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep . 
18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. 
19 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me. 
20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? 
21 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? 
22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.

"When somebody gets a wheelchair, especially someone who has been suffering you know, crawling on the ground—the first impression you see is a big smiling face.” In West Africa, Sierra Leone you’ll find the aftermath of a 10 year civil war that ended in 2002 where many continue to suffer from injuries, disorders and disease.

Malagie Bundor of Sierra Leone has spent his life with Spina Bifida. Given the skills to build his own wheelchair and wheelchairs for others you can’t help but see how proud it makes him feel. He says, “I use it to go to school. I use this wheelchair to enter into the classroom. I am able now to make a wheelchair for myself. Because I have been given the knowledge. I feel good that we make this wheelchair in this country. That’s a big thing. I am proud of it now. The last time I go into my village my father asked me ‘where do you get this wheelchair from?’ This wheelchair is made by myself.”

Sierra Leone has many who yet stand in need of wheelchairs and other donations or assistance. But through giveback.lds.org we don’t just donate, we help teach self-reliance. Throughout the world over 65 million people in the world require the use of a wheelchair. Help spread the word. Share this video using the hashtag: #igiveback.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints*NewVideo*Sitting on the Bench: Thoughts on Suicide Awareness and Prevention**rIxttI8tN1I**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rIxttI8tN1I/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**There is no easy solution for helping someone who has thoughts about suicide. But there are some things we can do to reach out to them.

The most common sources of pain for someone having suicidal thoughts are feeling disconnected from other people, feeling like they’re a burden to others or that people would be better off without them. Coupled with the hopeless thoughts that things aren’t going to change, suicidal thoughts become risky.

For some, like Seth Adam Smith, the right words spoken by another can change a life. Seth’s depression caused him to attempt suicide. He was miraculously saved, and when he awoke, his older brother’s words changed everything. “You know, Seth,” his older brother said, “I almost lost my little brother. … I don’t think I’m going to go anywhere for a while.”

While it may seem too simple, sometimes words of comfort, support, and love can be life-changing for someone who doesn’t feel needed.  

Sometimes those suffering with depression and suicidal thoughts don’t even need words. They just need someone to sit with them. They need someone to be there for them. They need to feel loved and valued. 

Elder M. Russell Ballard counsels us not to judge, but to reach out. “It doesn’t mean you’re going to be able to heal people, … but we can have an impact in guiding people to some of the resources out there.” He reminds us that we can be one of those resources. “There is nothing more powerful than the arm of love that can be put around those who are struggling.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*The Refiner's Fire**-DIIgm6xABQ**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-DIIgm6xABQ/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/blog/post/the-refiners-fire-mormon-message

The refiner’s fire is not a comfortable place to be. It involves intense heat and repeated hammering. But it is in the refiner’s fire that we are purified and prepared to meet God.

Kim experienced the refiner’s fire in a way she never expected. She had always wanted a large family. Her first son wasn’t even two when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor that claimed his life. Her daughter was diagnosed with bone cancer. She lost her husband and another son to cancer.

In her refiner’s fire, she “began to think maybe I couldn’t do this. Maybe I wasn’t strong enough. Maybe I might fail. But the Lord wasn’t going to allow me to fail. I know that’s not unique to me. He does that for everybody.” She learned that the Savior does provide what you need to face tragedies with faith and confidence.

She emerged from her fire with a great deal of joy and a desire to use what she has learned to help others. “The greater our sorrow is, the greater our capacity to feel joy.”

Losing loved ones is never easy, but she was surprised. “I feel a great deal of tenderness towards my Savior because He really is so sweet. He really does provide what you need.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Jesus Walking On Water - Wherefore Didst Thou Doubt?**2noonMEnSFg**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2noonMEnSFg/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos

Jesus Christ walks on water, and bids Peter to come unto Him.

Matt 14:25-33

25. And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. 
26. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. 
27. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer ; it is I; be not afraid. 
28. And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. 
29. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. 
30. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid ; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. 
31. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ? 
32. And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. 
33. Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

By God’s grace we are able to overcome any challenge life brings. And with His Grace we are able to feel much-needed love and comfort amidst our trials. One common trial of many families is drug addiction, a problem that may unfortunately lead to the death of a loved one.

It is important to know that you are not alone if you have struggled with drug addiction or if you have lost a loved one to death by overdose.

The family in this video shares their experience with drug addiction and the loss of a loved one: “We’re here in this life to overcome our challenges and become stronger. … Through our faith in our Savior Jesus Christ and knowing the price that He has paid for us—and for everyone on this earth—that has helped us get through the tough times.”

The New Testament teaches us about Jesus’s grace in Romans 5:2: “By [Jesus Christ] we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” In the Book of Mormon, Moroni 10:32–33 says: “Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God. And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.”

Through God’s grace we can become perfected. Through His grace, we, like this family, can be given the strength to endure life’s most difficult struggles.

Jesus provides a meal for 5000 people with only 5 loaves of bread and two fishes.

Matthew 14:13-21

13 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities. 
14 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick . 
15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals . 
16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. 
17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. 
18 He said, Bring them hither to me. 
19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. 
21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.

Brooke White sings “Something Divine” to remind us that we are all children of God who has given us talents and responsibilities. “Every star is different, and so is every child. Some are bright and happy, and some are meek and mild.”

But this is more than just a reminder that people are different. Our different strengths, talents, and gifts are God-given. They are an invitation for us to rise up to our potential and use them to bless lives: ours and others.

There’s something inside, the song reminds us. There’s something divine. We are children of a Father in Heaven who has a divine calling for each person. As we strive to be the best we can be, we are magnifying God’s plan and realizing the potential he has blessed us with.

“Stand with your face towards the sun and don’t give up until your work is done,” the song concludes. Let his light illuminate your path. Look to him for light and inspiration. “And in time, you’ll find something divine.”

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Syrian Refugee - “The moment I was shot I knew I would never walk again”**-015RQxil5A**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-015RQxil5A/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/give-back

Millions of Syrian refugees have been impacted by the Syrian civil war that broke out in 2011. Watch and listen to Nadia’s story; A 12 year old Syrian refugee child who, while fleeing Syria, was shot in the back and paralyzed.

Jesus said, ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends"" (John 15:13). We believe we can lay down our lives by giving back and placing another’s needs before our own through simple acts of kindness. Through the selflessness of others our hope can be restored. Something as simple as the donation of a wheelchair and clothing can be life changing for someone like Nadia and her family.

Share and comment ways you have been giving back in your own community or around the world. #igiveback

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints*NewVideo*Christ's Authority is Questioned - The Parable of The Two Sons**ZI8JWMNyEN0**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZI8JWMNyEN0/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos

Jesus Christ's authority is questioned by the chief priests and elders. He relates the parable of the two sons to them.

Matt 21:23-32

23. And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? 
24. And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
25. The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? 
26. But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet . 
27. And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. 
28. But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. 
29. He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. 
30. And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not . 
31. Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 
32. For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.

Jesus raises the son of the widow of Nain from death.

Luke 7:11-16

11. And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
12. Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
13. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
14. And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
15. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
16. And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.

2 Timothy 4: 1-8

1. I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; 
2. Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove , rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 
3. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers , having itching ears; 
4. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth , and shall be turned unto fables . 
5. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist , make full proof of thy ministry. 
6. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 
7. I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: 
8. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord, the righteous judge , shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.

Charity is the pure love of Christ. Charity never faileth.

1 Corinthians 13

1. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 
2. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
3. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
4. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
5. Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
6. Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
7. Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
8. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
9. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
10. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
11. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
12. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
13. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.

The Lord comforts Paul and says be of good cheer.  The Lord tells Paul that he must bear witness of Him in Rome.

Acts 23:11

And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.

“Whosoever Will Lose His Life for My Sake Shall Find It.” The Lord’s declaration, “he that findeth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it,” “Losing our life for the sake of the Lord is choosing to live a life wherein we daily avoid all that is unclean and keep the two great commandments — love of God and love of fellow man,”

How many things did you get checked off your “to- do” list today? Sometimes, the most important things you do each day were never even on your list. As we help a neighbor or family member, we often overlook the results. You might worry about the things you never get done, but President Gordon B. Hinckley reminds us, “You never know how much good you do.”

Paul teaches that the atonement of Jesus Christ is available for all of God's children.

Ephesians 2:10-22

10. For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. 
11. Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; 
12. That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope , and without God in the world: 
13. But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. 
14. For he is our peace , who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; 
15. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; 
16. And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: 
17. And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. 
18. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father. 
19. Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; 
20. And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; 
21. In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: 
22. In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.

Paul writes of one Lord, one faith, one baptism and one Father. Christ appointed apostles, prophets, and teachers to help unify and perfect the saints.

Ephesians 4:1-15

1. I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, 
2. With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 
3. Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
4. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; 
5. One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
6. One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. 
7. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 
8. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. 
9. (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? 
10. He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.) 
11. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 
12. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 
13. Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 
14. That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 
15. But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:

Paul preaches to Athenians on Mars Hill and identifies their ""unknown god"" as the Father of us all. He testifies that we all are children of God.

Acts 17:16-34

16. ¶Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
17. Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
18. Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
19. And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?
20. For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
21. (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
22. ¶Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
23. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
24. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
25. Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
26. And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
27. That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
28. For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
29. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.
30. And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
31. Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.
32. ¶And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.
33. So Paul departed from among them.
34. Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.

Peter and James speak to the Saints in Jerusalem to convince them that the Gentile converts are not subject to the requirements of the Law of Moses. 

Acts 15
7 ...Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;
9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.

13 ... Men and brethren, hearken unto me:
14 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
17 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.
21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
23 And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:
24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:
25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.
28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;
29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:
31 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.
33 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.
34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
36 ¶And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.
37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;
40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.
41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

Todd was someone who made fun of people who thought God was real, and he wasn’t surprised when he didn’t get an immediate answer to a prayer. But could God be giving us small but obvious answers? And how patient do we need to be to get those answers? 

You can find hope in God & Jesus Christ and know for a surety that they exist and love you.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*The Road to Damascus - Saul Takes his Journey**uPlez-rwhKY**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uPlez-rwhKY/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://mormonchannel.org/bible-videos

Saul takes his journey to Damascus. While on the road, Jesus appears to Saul. He is blinded by the event. Ananias restores Saul's sight. Saul is baptized.

Acts 22

1 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.
2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,
13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
18 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:
20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
23 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,
24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.
25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
26 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.
27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.
29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Blessed Are They That Have Not Seen, and Yet Have Believed - Thomas of the Bible**F8o4TrIA76U**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F8o4TrIA76U/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos

Thomas, one of the twelve, doubts the appearance of the risen Lord. Christ appears, and tells him, ""Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed.""

John 20: 24-29

24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
26 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.
27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

Elder M. Russell Ballard counsels on the importance of finding quiet time to hear the voice of the spirit amidst technological distractions. It is important to be still and listen and follow the Spirit. We simply have too many distractions to capture our attention, unlike any time in the history of the world.

Everyone needs time to meditate and contemplate. Even the Savior of the world, during His mortal ministry, found time to do so: “And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.”

We all need time to ask ourselves questions or to have a regular personal interview with ourselves. We are often so busy and the world is so loud that it is difficult to hear the heavenly words “be still, and know that I am God.”

Handheld devices, such as smartphones, are a blessing, but they can also distract us from hearing the “still, small voice.” They need to be our servants, not our masters. For example, if later tonight you share inspiring thoughts from this devotional on social media, your smartphone is a servant. If you randomly surf the Internet, your smartphone is a master.

Remember what Elijah learned: “The Lord was not in the wind; … the Lord was not in the earthquake: … the Lord was not in the fire,” but the Lord spoke in the “still small voice.”

The resurrected Christ appears to the apostles and tells them ""Peace be unto you!"" They touch His hands and feet and He eats with them. He tells them He will send them as His father sent Him.

Luke 24:36-41, 44-49

36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.
41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?
44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
48 And ye are witnesses of these things.
49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

John 20:21

21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

The resurrected Christ walks with two men on the road to Emmaus. He blesses and breaks bread with them, and then vanishes from sight. Their hearts burned within them.

 Luke 24: 13-35 13 

 13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.

 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

 15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

 16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

 17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?

 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?

 19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:

 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.

 21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.

 22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;

 23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.

 24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.

 25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:

 26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?

 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

 28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.

 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.

 30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.

 32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

 33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,

 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

 35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

The Son of God declares that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven, and that a house divided against itself shall fall.http://www.mormonchannel.org/bible-videos

Luke 11:14-26
14 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.
15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
16 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.
18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.
19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.
21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

Matthew 12:31-42
33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.
34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:
40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, teaches a rich man how to gain eternal life.

Matthew 19:16-26
16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?
17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.
22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
4 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.

Uchtdorf counsels us that when it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or wanting to cause harm—stop it!

We are all brothers and sisters. I imagine that every person on earth has been affected in some way by the destructive spirit of contention, resentment and revenge. The spirit of envy and hatred has led to some of the most tragic stories in history. Perhaps there are even times when we recognize this spirit in ourselves. 

(Text message notification) We are not perfect. The people around us are not perfect. Jess! Jess, come on! Mom needs the car! People do things that annoy, disappoint, and anger. Tho we cannot look into another's heart, we assume that we know a bad motive or even a bad person when we see one. This topic of judging others could actually be taught in a two-work sermon. When it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or wanting to cause harm, please apply the following: stop it! Jessica! Hey, why didn't you call me? What a loser. Hey, hurry up! Get in the car! Where were you?

(Text message notification) You okay? I'm fine. Whatever, well we got a youth activity tonight at the old folks home in like 30 minutes. Me and my friends are going to go if you want to come? 

(Text message notification) Mom we're home! Hey kids! Just leave the keys on the counter. I will be down in just a second. Have fun at your activity! Alright, well i'm going to start walking. Are you coming? No. I have homework. Alright, well don't drink all the juice! What? are you cheating? You have a wildcard up your sleeve. Hey, are you the one who made that picture of Melissa? What picture? You made her cry in biology today. Look um, I was just joking around, so people need to stop taking things so seriously. Jessica? Thanks for drinking all the juice! Jess!

(Text message notification) Jess! Jessica! Jess! (Hears sniffling outside) Hey! You okay? I looked at your phone. Who wrote that? Who cares. They're right. No, no Jess. Come here. No they're not. They don't know who you really are. Jess, they're just kidding around. You are just like them, especially at school. Haven't we all at one time or another meekly approached the mercy seat and pleaded for Grace. Haven't we've wished with all the energy of our souls for mercy to be forgiven for the mistakes we have made and the sins we have committed. 

Forgiving ourselves and others is not easy. In fact for most of us it requires a major change in our attitude and way of thinking even a change of heart. Consider the following questions as a self-test. Do you harbor grudge against someone else? Do you gossip even when what you say may be true? Do you exclude, push away, or punish others because of something they have done? Do you secretly envy another? Do you wish to cause harm to someone? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may want to apply the two-work sermon from earlier: Stop it! There's enough heartache and sorrow in this life without our adding to it through our own stubbornness, bitterness, and resentment. 

(Text message notification) This mighty change of heart is exactly what the Gospel of Jesus Christ is designed to bring about. I'm truly, truly sorry. Let us be kind, let us forgive, let us talk peacefully with each other, let us do good unto all men.
Allowing us to see others the way our Heavenly Father sees us, as flawed and imperfect mortals, who have potential and worth far beyond our capacity to imagine. Because God loves us so much, we too must love and forgive. Remember, in the end it is the merciful who obtain mercy.

John the Baptist is born. Zacharias prophesies of John's mission to prepare the way for the Son of God.

Luke 1 :57-80
57 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.
59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.
63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.
64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.
65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judæa.
66 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,
69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;
70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:
71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
72 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;
73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,
75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,
78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
79 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

This simple story illustrates the power of love and forgiveness in the face of bullying.

A bully in my class bullied me. One time he even hit me. It mad me sad, but I forgave him. When I was chosen to lead the class to the lunch room, I was asked to choose a friend to help me. I picked this boy because others never choose him. I wanted to make him feel good. He thanked me for choosing him. He began to be nice to me. It made me feel good too.

Mary and Joseph find Jesus about His father's business, teaching in the temple.

Luke 2:40-52
40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.
43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.
44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.
45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understandingand answers.
48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?
50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

Jesus declares the parable of the ten virgins.

Matthew 25:1-13
1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.

Jesus declares the parable of the talents.

Matthew 25:14-30
14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Jesus teaches of charity and the love of fellow men.

Matthew 25:31-46
31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.
46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

Those who humble themselves as little children are the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

Matthew 18:1-11;

1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,
3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
7 ¶Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
8 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. 


Mark 9 :38-42

38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
40 For he that is not against us is on our part.
41 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
42 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

Jesus invites little children to come unto him, and teaches how to gain eternal life.

Luke 18:15-17
15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
16 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
17 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

Jesus teaches there shall be joy in heaven over one repentant sinner. 

Luke 15:2-7
2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
3 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?
5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.
7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.

""Anyone who studies the workings of the human body has surely seen God moving in His majesty and power."" -Elder Russell M. Nelson

Anyone who studies the workings of the human body has surely seen God moving in His majesty and power. Each eye has an auto-focusing lens. Nerves and muscles control two eyes to make a single three-dimensional image. Each ear is connected to compact equipment designed to convert sound waves into audible tones. Your heart is an incredible pump. It has four delicate valves that open and close more than 100,000 times a day. Think of the body's defense system; it perceives pain, it generates antibodies. The body renews its own outdated cells and regulates the levels of its own vital ingredients. The many amazing attributes of your body attest to your own divine nature. 

The Apostle Paul described it as, ""a temple of God."" How could this be? Because your body is the temple for your spirit, and how you use your body affects your spirit. God is the father of our spirits. We are part of His divine purpose. When He created us physically we were created in the image of God. Development of the spirit is of eternal consequence. When we truly know our divine nature, then we will control our appetites. We will focus our eyes on sights, our ears on sounds, and our minds on thoughts that are a credit to our physical creation as a temple of our Father in Heaven. For these physical gifts, thanks be to God.

When making decisions, God expects us to pray, trust, and be believing and then not give up, panic, or ""jump ship"" when something doesn't seem to be going right. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shares a personal experience that reminds us to always trust God and the direction He gives us. 

(Voice of Elder Jeffrey R. Holland) There are times when the only way to get from A to C is by way of B. Having grown up in Southern Utah and enjoying all the wonders and beauties of Southern Utah and Northern Arizona, I wanted to introduce my son to that, and I wanted to show him places that I had seen and enjoyed when I was his age, so his mother packed a little lunch for us and we took his grandfather's pickup truck and headed South onto what we call the Old Arizona Strip. Noting that the Sun was going down we decided we better get back. But we came back to a particular fork in the road, really the only one, that at that point was absolutely unrecognizable. I asked my son to pray about which road to take, and he felt strongly that we should go to the right, and I did as well, and we went to the right and it was a dead end. We went four or five or six hundred yards and it was an absolute dead-end, clearly the wrong road. We turned around, came back out, took the other road and clearly the road to the left was the correct road. Somewhere along the way Matt said, ""Dad, why did we feel, after praying about it, that the right road was the proper one to take, the correct one to take, and it wasn't?"" And I said, ""I think that the Lord, His wish for us there, and his answer to our prayer was to get us on the right road as quickly as possible with some reassurance, with some understanding, that we were on the right road and we didn't have to worry about it, and in this case, the easiest way to do that was to let us go 400 yards or 500 yards on the wrong road, and very quickly know, without a doubt, that it was the wrong road, and therefore with equal certainty with equal conviction that the other one was the right road."" I have absolute certain knowledge, perfect knowledge, that God loves us. He is good, He is our Father, and He expects us to pray, and trust, and be believing, and not give up, and not panic, and not retreat, and not jump ship, when something doesn't seem to be going just right. We stay in, we keep working, we keep believing, keep trusting, following that same path and we will live to fall in His arms and feel His embrace and hear Him say, ""I told you that it'd be okay, I told you it would be all right.""

Jesus performs a miracle by healing an invalid on the sabbath day.

John 5:2-12
2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 
3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 
5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 
6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 
7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 
8 Jesus saith unto him, Rise , take up thy bed, and walk. 
9 And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath . 
10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. 
11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?

Successful families are built and maintained with faith, love, compassion, work and wholesome recreational activities.

In our lives these days there are so many things that are trying to matter to us; emails, and phone calls, and advertisements and all these things that kind of a barrage us, but I feel like some of the strongest, happiest moments that I've ever felt in my life are when I'm with my children, when I'm with my family. And it's when we come out and do things like this when we get away from the world and we're just together as a family and we can relax, and you know, laugh at each other, and mom says something crazy and and that makes, you know, my brother Casey say something to her. 

As we grow up and we get older and we all kind of go our own ways and we start living our own lives, you know, fulfilling our own dreams, it's really good to come back together and reconnect. If we ever need anything we're always there for one another. We talk to our family quite often by telephone and they can say they're fine and everything's great, but you don't get a true feel of how their life is going in a five-minute telephone call. But if you get together as a family you can see how their family is together, how they are reacting together, and if they're happy or if they have problems.

We all talk about it together, we all work it out together. ""Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities.""

Jesus teaches not to lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, but rather to lay up treasures in heaven.

Luke 12:13-34
13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. 
14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 
15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness : for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. 
16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 
17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? 
18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 
19 And I will say to my soul, Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat , drink, and be merry. 
20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? 
21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God. 
22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on. 
23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment. 
24 Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls? 
25 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? 
26 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? 
27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 
28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith? 
29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. 
30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. 
31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you. 
32 Fear not, little flock ; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom . 
33 Sell that ye have, and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. 
34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

Jesus calls Peter, Andrew, James and John to follow Him. 

Matthew 4: 18-22
18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers . 
19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. 
20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. 
21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. 
22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.

By following Him, remembering Him, and having faith in Him we can change and become what we aspire to become. (Part 3 of 3) 

(Voice of Elder D. Todd Christofferson) The bread of eternal life, the core substance that we need to become what we aspire to become, is in the person of Jesus Christ. His Atonement, His suffering for sin, and the resultant capacity to extend mercy, He can heal and forgiven and cleanse anything. I don't think everyone realizes that when we do sin, when we turn away from God, it does something in us, and when we repent and turn to Him, that affect in us is taken away. With His Atonement we become different people then we would be without it and its power is infinite, truly infinite and can reach down and sanctify and make holy, to the uttermost, any soul. 

There's a purpose in life far beyond living comfortably; the bread we receive is to enable us to act and to help and to serve. Not only are we helping but we're being blessed and helped and changed. We're not transformed, as you know, overnight, these things come in process of time; changes are incremental and people don't see them until they look back and see where they are as opposed to where they were. Just as I learned not to expect immediate deliverance from a problem, He's also saying ""I'm patient with your progress, I'll just help you along day by day"" and all of that truly does add up to dramatic change, an eternal difference. When the Isrealites finally did cross the Jordan into their promised land, they were expected by God to remember Him, to think of Him, to look to Him, to have faith in Him. 

As we turn to Him each day and remember Him each day, we come to know by experience that He's real and that He does care about and love us and minister to us, just as He did the ancient Israelites because He is the Bread of Life.

Elder D. Todd Christofferson shares a personal experience that taught him to truly pray, recognize answers to prayers, and take life one day at a time. (Part 2 of 3)


(Voice of Elder D. Todd Christofferson) To a large extent, I believe our faith in God is a consequence, or fruit, of experience. Quite a few years ago I made a financial investment in a small business and it began to require more to stay afloat. Yet, it still didn't do well and then more was required, and it became a terrible economic threat. I remember having to go before the Lord with nowhere else to turn, and in tears and pleading to seek for to seek for anything that He would provide in His love and wisdom. What I learned in that process was what it's like to come to a point in your life where you really have nowhere to turn but to God. And in those circumstances one truly learns how to pray and how to receive the answers that come. Sometimes it was nothing more than a feeling that things would work out somehow; no indication of how or when but it would be alright. Sometimes it was an idea that would make a difference. And so it became during portions of this experience, a matter of getting the manna for that day; the help that could only come from Him, from God, for the moment, not the long-term, just the immediate need. I think what we have to do when the pressures are there and the clouds are dark and threatening, is take life one day at a time. It helps at times not to think too far ahead and just do what the day requires; ""Give us this day our daily bread."" We're not anticipating the hardship or suffering that might be entailed, we sometimes just have to break it down to this moment, this day, and while deliverance isn't immediate and you may not see the end, still you've got enough for today. When this began happening in my life my prayer was ""Give me a miracle,"" you know, ""Solve this problem,"" and it took a while to finally come to the point of saying, ""I'm content to get a daily help, and let it take what time it takes,"" knowing that I can rely upon God. It's been a blessing to me ever since to have had that rather harrowing experience because of what it meant for my relationship with Him. Maybe the greater blessing for us is to have to walk through it with Him.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Daily Bread: Pattern**2eMJ6ZDCAp4**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2eMJ6ZDCAp4/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/video/mormon-messages - Just as we need daily physical sustenance, the need for daily spiritual sustenance is just as strong. For the Children of Israel, manna was a daily reminder of the source of their blessings; today, we can remember Jesus Christ every day as we pray, read the scriptures, and meditate. (Part 1 of 3) 

(Voice of Elder D. Todd Christofferson) I think it's not by chance God has created us in a way that we have to have daily physical sustenance. The Children of Israel coming out of Egypt lived for forty years, approximately, on something called manna. They couldn't have lived from hunting, and their lifestyle was such that they couldn't be planting, so they really didn't have an alternative. God was in essence providing their daily sustenance. And I think at least one of His purposes was to teach them to remember Him, to think of Him, to look to Him, to have faith in Him, that He was the source of their life. He did in the way of making it a daily thing; they couldn't gather up manna and store it, it would only be good for one day. They couldn't forget who was the source their blessings. 

There's a spiritual parallel in our day. We all recognize the need for physical sustenance; hunger and thirst remind us very strongly if we forget. But the spiritual need for sustenance is equally strong, that comes not in drinking water and eating food but in our constant daily efforts of communion with God. We ought not to think that we can go weeks and months without spiritual sustenance and not suffer, and not have a deadening influence in our spiritual life. Acknowledging the reality of our need for a daily spiritual ministration, or manna, helps us increase in our courage to do the right thing, and to serve others, more than we would have if we ignored God. People sometimes think ""Well, those are such small things; prayer, immersing ourselves in the scriptures, pondering, meditating; how can that really produce a significant difference in a person's life?"" But it does. As small as those things seem to be, as daily, routine sometimes they may seem to be, these are the kinds of things that day by day, transform us.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*The Good Shepherd and Other Sheep I Have**iKwabH-k2fg**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iKwabH-k2fg/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos

Jesus is the Good Shepherd. He declares that His Father commanded Him to lay down His life, and take it up again. 

John 10:1-18

1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 
2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep . 
3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 
4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice . 
5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers . 
6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them. 
7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 
8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 
9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. 
10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal , and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly . 
11 I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 
12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. 
13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 
14 I am the good shepherd , and know my sheep, and am known of mine. 
15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. 
17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. 
18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

Everybody makes mistakes, and even though it's not easy, with the help of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ we can receive forgiveness for our sins. http://mormonchannel.org/mormon-messages

So on my last birthday my mom and dad gave me a shiny chrome bike. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen. I could do all kinds of tricks, and I was so much faster than everyone else. But then, my friend Evan got a red bike. It was fast too. Then everyone got a red bike. Mine just wasn't good enough anymore. I had an idea, but my parents said I shouldn't do it. I decided to do it anyway. This was the best idea I've ever had. My friends were going to be so jealous when they saw my bike. But, when I started painting the bike, the red paint started dripping off the chrome. It was the worst thing that could have happened. I thought it was ruined forever. I went to my parents to ask for their help. I thought they would be so mad, but they weren't. My dad told me that people make mistakes and there's always a way to fix them. He gave me a bunch of tools and he said it would be a lot of hard work, but that we could make my bike shiny again. It took a long time. I could see my friends outside and I wanted to go play with them, but I knew I needed to keep working on my bike. I never thought it would work; but finally, the red paint started coming off! I could see how great it was going to be. Soon, my bike was just about perfect. My dad helped me so much. Race you to the park! ""Although the path is not easy, the promise is real: 'Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.'""

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Jesus Acclaims John the Baptist - Come Unto Me**S4uK6kUfoyQ**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4uK6kUfoyQ/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos/

Jesus acclaims John the Baptist; rebukes unbelievers; and declares His burden is light.

Matthew 11:1-30
1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. 
2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, 
3And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? 
4 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: 
5 The blind receive their sight , and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. 
6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. 
7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 
8 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses. 
9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 
11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. 
13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. 
15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
16 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, 
17 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. 
18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. 
19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. 
20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: 
21 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes . 
22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. 
23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 
24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. 
25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes . 
26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. 
27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. 
28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest . 
29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 
30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Peter's Revelation to Take the Gospel to the Gentiles**HeEUuzU9MQg**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HeEUuzU9MQg/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**https://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos/

Peter follows the commandment of the Lord to take the gospel to the Gentiles.

Acts 10:1-48; 11:1-18

11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.
16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,
18 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?
22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.
23 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
24 And the morrow after they entered into Cæsarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.
26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
29 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.
33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)
37 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judæa, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

Jesus explains how we are to treat our offending brethren.

Matthew 18: 21-35

21Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.
24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.
25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.
29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.
31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:
33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?
34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

Jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son.

Luke 15: 11-32

11 And he said, A certain man had two sons:
12 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.
13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.
14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!
18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:
24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.
26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and entreated him.
29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.
32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

This biography of President Thomas S. Monson's life highlights some of his great memories and experiences. Included in this video are interviews with President Monson, family members, and friends

In the office of President Thomas S. Monson hangs a painting of the Savior, a portrayal of the Lord Jesus Christ by famed artist Heinrich Hofmann. President Monson has had the painting since he was a bishop in the 1950s. It represents an ideal example—the Master after whom Thomas Monson has modeled his life.

“I love that painting,” President Monson says as he gazes at it yet again. “I feel strength in having it near me. Look at the kindness in those eyes. Look at the warmth of expression. When facing difficult situations, I often look at it and ask myself, ‘What would He do?’ Then I have tried to respond accordingly.”

Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven through several parables.

Matt 13: 44-51

 44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
 45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:
 46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
 47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
 48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
 49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
 50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
 51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

Jesus explains the meaning of the parable of the wheat and tares.

Matthew 13:36-43

36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;
38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;
42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

Jesus declares the first and great commandment is to love God with all your heart.

Mark 12:28-34

28. And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? 
29. And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear , O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 
30. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment. 
31. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. 
32. And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 
33. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 
34. And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.

Toward the end of World War II, my mother decided to flee to Germany where her parents were living. Though I was only three years old, I can still remember this time of fear and hunger. Along the way the train stopped occasionally to get supplies. One night, during one of these stops, my mother hurried out of the train to search for some food for her four children. I know with certainty, her faith overcame her fear, and her hope overcame her despair.

Jesus teaches He is the bread of life, and how salvation is gained by eating the living bread. Peter testifies that Jesus is the anointed Son of God.

John 6:25-71
25. And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
26. Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
27. Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
28. Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
29. Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
30. They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
31. Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
32. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.
33. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
34. Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
35. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
36. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
37. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
38. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
39. And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
40. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.

Everyone deserves to be loved and valued, no matter how different they are from you.

Listen to an interview with the father of Hannah and Hyrum about their story: 
https://www.mormonchannel.org/mormon-channel-daily/221

http://mormonchannel.org/mormon-messages

Hi, my name is Hannah and this is a story about my brother, Hyrum.  Hyrum is my big brother and he is eight years old.  He's my best friend.  Hyrum is like other kids; he likes to run, he likes to play, and he loves movies.  But he is also different.  Sometimes, he likes to have adventures in his mind.  My brother has autism.  Autism means you think things different.  It doesn't make you bad, it just makes you different.  Sometimes, my brother has a hard time telling us how he feels.  Mom has him draw things on paper to help us understand him and what he is thinking.  Sometimes, kids tease my brother because they don't understand him.  I wish people knew my brother like I do.  I know he cares about me, even when he acts funny.  I love my brother, and he loves me, and we like to go on adventures, like camping, building fires, and roasting marshmallows.  He also likes to go to the park or the zoo.  Dad says that one day, Hyrum will be able to talk just like me, and tell me how he feels all the time.  We don't know why Hyrum has autism; we just know that Heavenly Father made all of us special.  Jesus said that we should be kind to all of our brothers and sisters.  I want to be like Jesus, don't you?  "True love can alter human lives and change human nature.  I plead with you to have the courage to refrain from judging and criticizing those around you, as well as the courage to make certain everyone is included and feels loved and valued."

Jesus foretells of His death and resurrection. After He comes in the glory of His Father, every man shall be rewarded according to their works.

Matt 16:21--28

21. From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. 
22. Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. 
23. But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. 
24. Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross , and follow me. 
25. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. 
26. For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? 
27. For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works . 
28. Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom .

Peter testifies that Jesus is the Son of God. Jesus declares that He will give the keys of the kingdom to Peter.

Matthew 16: 13-19

13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Cæsarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? 
14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias ; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 
15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 
16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God. 
17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar -jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. 
18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. 
19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Having Children Enriches Your Life**c16vm9r1ZMI**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c16vm9r1ZMI/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/video/mormon-messages - Listen to experiences from married couples and discover how they found blessings within their families because of their decision to have children.

We have two kids; we have a two and a half year old and a nine month old. We were ready to have kids when we kind of realized there's so much more to life than being places. While we were living in Philadelphia, taking the train to New York, and pursuing all these really great dreams that we had, I didn't realize there was a whole other part of my heart that would open up. At first I did not really want to have a kid. I hadn't finished my school yet. We watched Elder Andersen's talk, ""Children,"" and during the talk he said, ""Where is your faith?"" I thought that piercing question was just for me. And I felt right about having a kid. ""We go forward in faith, realizing the decision of how many children to have, and when to have them, is between a husband and wife and the Lord."" I'm like, ""No, no we can't do this. What are we going to do now? We're going to have a baby, and now we're going to have twins!"" I was just kind of freaking out. And it was this big jump of ""hey this is a big step."" Actually we have four little boys, because he's one. As a father, I fill a significant chunk of his world. We are just finding that everyday things you're going to do are more fun, like unloading the dishwasher, the clean dishes; the plastic stuff. I think a common misconception with having kids is that life is over. I'm an artist and I somehow am able to get it done just the same as I did before. It's been really cool to see and be a part of how the Lord is just making it happen. If I can take the time to just listen and to see my children, then it just makes it where those moments when you could become frustrated suddenly you just see the frustration in their eyes and your heart is filled with compassion. It's a combination of patience and also just not taking things too seriously about life. We learn how to love in our home. It's such an important thing. Looking back, you know we had a great life but we have a great life now. And I wouldn't give it up for anything. I think that Heavenly Father really is trying to help us succeed. He has this wonderful plan, the Plan of Salvation, and as we faithfully follow the plan and do our part, He will help us.

It is a privilege for a husband and wife to be able to bear children. The decision on when to have children takes faith and is between a husband and wife and the Lord.

It is the crowning privilege of a husband and wife who are able to bear children to provide mortal bodies for these Spirit children of God. We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the Earth remains in force. We go forward in faith, realizing the decision of how many children to have, and when to have them, is between a husband and wife and the Lord. My daughters recently referred me to a blog written by a Christian mother, not of our faith, with five children. She commented, ""Growing up in this culture, children rank way below college, below world travel for sure, below the ability to go out at night at your leisure."" She then adds, ""Motherhood is not a hobby; you do not collect children because you find them cuter than stamps. It's not something you if you can squeeze the time in, It is what God gave you time for."" And Jesus took a child in His arms and said, 'Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me, and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me.'

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Having Courage & Trusting the Lord: Stand Up for What You Believe In**6nLsNRopWQE**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6nLsNRopWQE/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/video/mormon-messages - Learn from the life of Esther and other inspiring women the importance of trusting in God and courageously standing up for what you believe. 

To approach the king uninvited was to risk execution; even for the queen. I know I never thought about this being brave, I just had to have faith that God was going to help me. Everybody has trials and things in their life that don't go as planned. It's hard, every day. For me surviving is about two things: courage and faith. (Anne Marie) I just thought, 'I have to do something.' (Maria) I looked up to the heavens and prayed. (Desirae) I knew that death was a possibility. (Anne Marie) I know we get a variety of different trials. (Desirae) I was diagnosed in August of 2011. I think it's amazing how just one brief moment can change the course of everything. (Anne Marie) So, one day I went into work and the company decided they wanted to do something that was against my beliefs. So I thought, 'Okay, well I need to stand up for what I need to stand up for and do what I need to do.' (Maria) My husband said he would come home for lunch but was hit by a car, and did never come back. I have felt the loss. (Desirae) It was probably the scariest moment of my life. (Anne Marie) You don't ever realize how strong you are until being strong is all that you have left. (Desirae) Being brave doesn't mean that I'm not afraid. (Anne Marie) Brave is just acting in faith. (Desirae) When we know we don't want to face it, but we know we don't have any other option. We just have to push forward. (Anne Marie) I quit my job. We don't know what the Lord is trying to teach us, but if I really trust Heavenly Father, it really doesn't matter what I don't understand. (Desirae) I know that God has a plan for me that usually is totally different than the plan that I have for myself. It's not always easier, but it's always better. (Maria) In time, I felt peace. With faith in God, I have everything.

Trusting in the Lord and standing up for what you believe in is hard, turn to the scriptures and have courage and faith and you will grow stronger.

Conspiring men seek to entangle Jesus in His words. Instead, the Savior wittingly teaches them that it is possible to respect civil authority and honor God.

Mark 12:13-17 

13 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.
14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or not?
15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.
16 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Cæsar's.
17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.

Acts 5: 12-42

12 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch. 
13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them. 
14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) 
15 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them. 
16 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. 
17 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation , 
18 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison. 
19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, 
20 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life. 
21 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. 
22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told, 
23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. 
24 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow. 
25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. 
26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned. 
27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, 
28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. 
29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. 
30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. 
31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour , for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. 
32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost , whom God hath given to them that obey him. 
33When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them. 
34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel , a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; 
35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. 
36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. 
37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. 
38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men , it will come to nought: 
39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. 
40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 
41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name . 
42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.

""Many of you are now passing through physical, mental, and emotional trials that could cause you to cry out, 'When I've tried all my life to be good, why has this happened to me?' Now I wish to encourage those who in the midst of hard trials who feel their faith may be fading under the onslaught of troubles. There seems to me no better answer to the question of why trials come, and what we are to do, than the words of the Lord Himself, who passed through trials for us more terrible than we can imagine. You may have seen the need for that foundation as I have, at the bedside of someone ready to give up the fight to endure to the end. If the foundation of faith is not embedded in our hearts, the power to endure will crumble. [Mother yelling to her son] 

Moroni, the son of Mormon in the Book of Mormon told us how. He teaches the simple and sweet truth that acting on even a twig of faith allows God to grow it. That particle of faith --most precious-- which you should protect, and use to whatever extent you can, is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. You and I have faith, that the way to rise through and above trials, is to believe that there is a Balm in Gilead, and that the Lord has promised, 'I will not forsake thee. 'Curing does not come automatically through the passage of time, but it does take time. Getting older does not do it alone, it is serving God and others persistently with full heart and soul that turns testimony of truth into unbreakable spiritual strength. If we have faith in Jesus Christ, the hardest, as well as the easiest of times in life can be a blessing. In all conditions all we can choose the right with the guidance of the spirit. We have the gospel of Jesus Christ shape and guide our lives if we choose it. We never need to feel that we are alone or unloved in the Lord's service because we never are. We can feel the love of God. The Savior has promised angels are on our left and on our right to bear us up, and He always keeps His word. His love is unfailing I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.""

Acts 4:5-21

5 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
6 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
16 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
18 And they called them, and acommanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.
20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.

Fatherhood is a divine responsibility to be cherished.

I'm awake. I remember Him. I gaze upon them before I part. They lie in their bed, unaware of me watching. I leave, they sleep. The small home I help provide is their world. They play, they explore, learning to move, to feel, to see, to know, not once thinking how it all came to be. Crayons, toys, books; it's all for them. The fridge opens, the pantry exposed, they expect food to be there. Not a thought, not a doubt, just hunger. Cereal, milk, yogurt, messy fingers, messy faces, all fed. Tummies are full. Now it's nap time. My wife likes nap time. Once again, they lay in the comfort we provide. 

All while I work, I'm far, but close; always thinking of them. My phone rings, I only hear breathing. I smile; my wife's phone is now missing. I do it all for them. I work, that they may grow. They trust so deeply; how I yearn to do the same. They see so little of how it all came to be, never questioning, only trusting. I come home; two-second hugs. Now I'm a horse. We eat dinner, brush teeth. Jammy time. Finally, it's bed time. Once again, they lay their heads on the pillows we provide. I will be their protector. I will be their gentle friend. I will be my wife's faithful husband. I am a father, I am also a son. And while I may not understand all that He does for me, I do know that all that I am, and all that I have is because He's a father to me. I now stand, very aware, of how it all came to be.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints*NewVideo*Peter Preaches and is Arrested**yU3Hqpc8AYE**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yU3Hqpc8AYE/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**http://www.mormonchannel.org/watch/series/bible-videos

Peter and John are arrested for preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ in Jerusalem.

Acts 3:12-26, 4:1-3

12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?
13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.
14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;
15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
7 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.
18 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;
20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:
21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.
25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.
1 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
2 Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.

With authority from Jesus Christ, Peter and John heal a man crippled since birth.

Acts 3: 1-8

1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. 
2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 
3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms . 
4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. 
5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. 
6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. 
7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. 
8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

President Dieter F. Uchtdorf shares a humorous parable of a man who realizes he has been living far beneath his privileges.

There once was a man whose lifelong dream was to board a cruise ship and sail the Mediterranean Sea. He saved every penny until he had enough for his passage. He dreamed of walking the streets of Rome, Athens, and Istanbul. Since money was tight he brought an extra suitcase filled with cans of beans, boxes of crackers, and bags of powdered lemonade, and that is what he lived on every day. He would have loved to take part in the many activities offered on the ship; he envied those who went to movies, shows, and cultural presentations, and oh, how he yearned for only a taste of the amazing food he saw on the ship. But the man wanted to spend so very little money that he didn't participate in any of these. He was able to see the cities he had longed to visit, but for the most part of the journey, he stayed in his cabin and ate only his humble food. On the last day of the cruise, a crew member asked him which of the farewell parties he would be attending. It was then that the man learned that not only the farewell party, but almost everything on board the cruise ship, the food and entertainment, all the activities, had been included in the price of the ticket. Too late, the man realized that he had been living far beneath his privileges. We live beneath our privileges when we fail to partake of the feast of happiness, peace, and joy that God grants so bountifully. We can be satisfied with a diminished experience and settle for experiences far below our privileges, or we can partake of an abundant feast of spiritual opportunity and universal blessings. As you read the scriptures and listen to the words of the prophets with all your heart and mind the Lord will tell you how to live up to your privileges and we will be able to do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

Share the good tidings of great joy: that He lives!

Luke 2:1-20

1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed . 
2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) 
3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 
4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem ; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 
5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 
6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 
7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn . 
8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people. 
11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord . 
12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 
14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace , good will toward men. 
15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 
16 And they came with haste , and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. 
17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. 
18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. 
19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. 
20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

Lyrics:

O come, O come, Emmanuel
 and ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel. 

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny
From depths of Hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel. 

O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel. 

O come, Thou Key of David, come, 
And open wide our heavenly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high, 
And close the path to misery.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, O come, Thou Lord of might,
Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
In ancient times did'st give the Law,
In cloud, and majesty and awe.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

Jesus clears worldly merchandise from the temple courts in order to keep the temple a holy place.

John 2:13-17

13 ¶And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, 
14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 
15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; 
16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. 
17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

Jesus shows that He has power to both forgive sins and heal physical infirmities.

Mark 2: 1-12

1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. 
2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. 
3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. 
4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. 
5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. 
6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 
7 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? who can forgive sins but God only? 
8 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? 
9 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? 
10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) 
11 I say unto thee, Arise , and take up thy bed , and go thy way into thine house. 
12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

Jesus demonstrates His divine power by raising a young girl from the dead.

Mark 5:22-24, 35-43

22 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 
23 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live. 
24 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him. 

35 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? 
36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe . 
37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 
38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. 
39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado , and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. 
40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. 
41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise . 
42 And straightway the damsel arose , and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. 
43 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.

Jesus teaches about compassion when confronted with a woman accused of adultery.

John 8: 2-11

2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 
3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst, 
4 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 
5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 
6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 
7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 
8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 
11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

Jesus teaches his disciples the correct manner of prayer and offers the Lord's prayer.

Matthew 6:1-13

1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. 
2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 
4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. 
5 ¶And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 
7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 
8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. 
9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name . 
10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. 
11 Give us this day our daily bread . 
12 And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors. 
13 And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory , for ever. Amen.

Jesus teaches His followers essential Christian traits, such as kindness, forgiveness, and love.

Matthew 5: 17-48

17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 
18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled . 
19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: 
22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca , shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. 
23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; 
24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. 
25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. 
26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. 
27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery : 
28 But I say unto you, That who soever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. 
29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell . 
30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. 
31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement : 
32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. 
33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths : 
34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne : 
35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. 
36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. 
37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. 
38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 
39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also. 
40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. 
41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 
42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. 
43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thine enemy. 
44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies , bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; 
45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 
46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 
47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? 
48 Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect .

Jesus teaches His followers essential Christian traits, such as kindness, forgiveness, and love.

Matthew 5:1-16

1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: 
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
4 Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted . 
5 Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth . 
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled. 
7 Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy. 
8 Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God. 
9 Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of God. 
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 
12 Rejoice , and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. 
13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. 
14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. 
15 Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 
16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

Jesus instructs and empowers His original Twelve Apostles.

Matthew 10:1-11

1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. 
2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 
3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the  
4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: 
6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers , raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give . 
9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses , 
10 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat . 
11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

Jesus heals a woman's illness when she, in faith, touches His clothing.

Mark 5: 25-34

25 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, 
26 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, 
27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment . 
28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. 
29 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. 
30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes? 
31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
32 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. 
33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 
34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague.

Jesus announces that He is the Messiah prophesied by Isaiah but is rejected by His neighbors in Nazareth. 

Luke 4: 15-30

15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. 
16 ¶And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. 
17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, 
18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty 
19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. 
20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. 
21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. 
22And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph 's son? 
23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country. 
24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country. 
25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; 
26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. 
27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian. 
28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, 
29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. 
30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

In the darkness of night, Jesus teaches Nicodemus about the necessity of every person being born again.

John 3: 1-36

1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews: 
2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 
3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God. 
4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 
5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 
6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. 
8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit . 
9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 
10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 
11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness . 
12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? 
13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. 
14 ¶And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 
15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. 
16 ¶For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life . 
17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved . 
18 ¶He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 
20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 
21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. 
22 ¶After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judæa; and there he tarried with them, and baptized . 
23 ¶And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much  
24 For John was not yet cast into prison. 
25 of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. 
26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth,  
27 John answered and said, A man can  
28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 
29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 
30 He must increase, but I must decrease. 
31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. 
32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony. 
33 He that hath received his testi mony hath set to his seal that God is true. 
34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. 
35 The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand. 
36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

Jesus seeks out John the Baptist and is baptized in order to fulfill all righteousness. 

Matthew 3: 13-17

13 ¶Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 
14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 
15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . Then he suffered him. 
16 And Jesus, when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him: 
17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased.

Mary was highly favored of God and chosen to be the mother of Jesus Christ. Her humility, devotion, and strength stand as a model for all Christian disciples.

Luke 1: 26-35

26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 
27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 
28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women . 
29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. 
30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 
31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus . 
32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David : 
33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end . 
34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 
35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

Jesus demonstrates His divine power by healing a possessed man. 

Luke 4: 33-37

33 ¶And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, 
34 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. 
35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not. 
36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. 
37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.

Jesus performs a miraculous act of service in one of the first recorded events of His ministry. 

John 2: 1-12

1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 
2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. 
3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 
4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman , what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 
5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. 
6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 
7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. 
9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, 
10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. 
11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 
12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren , and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

Peter and John find the empty tomb.  Jesus, now resurrected, appears to Mary.

John 20: 3-18

3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. 
4 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. 
5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 
6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 
7 And the napkin , that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. 
8 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. 
9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead . 
10 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. 
11 ¶But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, 
12 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. 
14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 
16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master . 
17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father , and your Father; and to my God, and your God. 
18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.

A band of soldiers strips Jesus of His clothes, scourges Him, and mocks Him. He then carries His cross to Golgotha and is crucified by Roman soldiers. 

Matthew 27: 26-50

26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. 
27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. 
28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. 
29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. 
31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. 
32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. 
33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull , 
34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. 
35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. 
36 And sitting down they watched him there; 
37 And set up over his head his accusation written, This Is Jesus the King of the Jews . 
38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. 
39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 
40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. 
41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, 
42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 
43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 
44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. 
45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. 
46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God , my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. 
48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. 
49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. 
50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.

Jesus is tried before Caiaphas and the chief priests. Peter denies knowing Him and weeps bitterly. 

Matthew 26: 57-75

57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 
58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. 
59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 
60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses , 
61 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 
62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
63 But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 
64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. 
66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death . 
67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, 
68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? 
69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 
70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 
71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. 
72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 
73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. 
74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. 
75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

Jesus admonishes Peter to remain faithful and strengthen his brethren. Peter professes his devotion to Jesus. Jesus foretells Peter's denial and then gives the Intercessory Prayer. 

Luke 22: 31-34

31 ¶And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to b have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 
32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren. 
33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. 
34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

Meeting in an upper room with His disciples, Jesus washes their feet, institutes the sacrament, and commands them to love one another.

John 13: 1-35

1 Now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; 
3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. 
5 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 
6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
8 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. 
10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean , but not all. 
11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. 
12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 
13 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. 
14 If I then, your Lord and Master , have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet . 
15 For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you. 
16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. 
17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. 
18 ¶I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. 
19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he. 
20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 
21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. 
23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved. 
24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. 
25 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 
26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 
27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 
28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 
29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night. 
31 ¶Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. 
33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. 
34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 
35 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

Jesus is arraigned and questioned before Pilate, who finds no fault in Him. Yielding to the multitude, Pilate allows Barabbas to be released and Jesus to be crucified. 

Matthew 27: 1-2, 11-25

1 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 
2 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. 

11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. 
12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing . 
13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? 
14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. 
15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would . 
16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 
17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? 
18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. 
19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. 
20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. 
21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. 
22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified . 
23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. 
24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. 
25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.

Jesus rides in triumph into Jerusalem. The multitudes greet Him with shouts of Hosanna to the Son of David. (Matthew 21: 1-11)

Ponder what the Savior means to all humanity—and to you personally. And then share the good news. 

John 20: 11-17

11 ¶But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, 
12 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. 
14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 
16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master . 
17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father , and your Father; and to my God, and your God.

The Savior's body is taken by Joseph of Arimathea to a garden tomb.  Angels appear and remove the stone from the front of the tomb. Mary and other women visit the empty tomb. 

Matthew 27: 57-60

57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathæa, named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus' disciple : 
58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. 
59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed.

Jesus, Peter, James, and John retire to the Garden of Gethsemane.  Jesus submits to the Father's will and begins to suffer for the sins and afflictions of mankind. He is then betrayed and arrested. 

Matthew 26: 36-57

36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 
37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. 
38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. 
39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed , saying, O my Father , if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt. 
40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep , and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 
41 Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. 
42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 
43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 
44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 
45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. 
47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. 
49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 
50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. 
51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. 
52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 
53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? 
54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? 
55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 
56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. 
57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

A depiction of the Savior's parable of the good Samaritan, in which a man is robbed and beaten by thieves, and a Samaritan shows mercy on him.

Luke 10: 25-37

25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? 
27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. 
28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live . 
29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour ? 
30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. 
31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 
32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. 
33 But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, 
34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. 
35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host , and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. 
36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? 
37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

While traveling through Samaria, the Savior teaches a woman at Jacob's Well that He is the "living water." 

John 4: 5-29

5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph . 
6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 
7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans . 
10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. 
15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. 
16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 
18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 
19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet . 
20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 
23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 
24 God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth . 
25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 
26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. 
27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 
28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 
29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?

A poor widow contributes her all into the temple treasury. Jesus teaches that her contribution is greater than that of the rich who gave of their abundance. 

Mark 12: 41-44

41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 
42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing. 
43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: 
44 For all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

When I was eight years old I was baptized, but shortly after that I fell away from the Church. I ran into Word of Wisdom issues I ran into all sorts of issues. I ended up just wondering if there is a God, just wondering if there is something there. I was talking with my uncle, one evening, and he started talking to me about the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He told me to go pray about these things that we talked about and as I went down into my room and knelt at the side of my bed, I Started to say this prayer.I remember a feeling that started off in my heart and it felt like it just filled my whole body, it felt like this power was just overwhelming, but for a split moment that fear was instantly replaced with this feeling of clarity. I knew exactly what I had to do with with my life. The Holy Ghost helped increase my testimony because he testified to me that all the things I've been learning are true or when other people are giving their testimonies I also feel the Spirit which testifies to me that what they are saying is true. My life just completely changed you know it's like when I say here's you know I would be on this path without the Spirit, on this path with the Spirit. I obviously would not have gone on my mission. My mission was I mean it was everything to me it was exactly what I needed right then.The main lesson that I took away was finding a way to have the Spirit with me. It took me about nine full months and I remember getting down on my knees and saying to Heavenly Father "we're not having very much success you know I'm here to work, you know help me to understand this." I woke up the next day and I just remember it was really interesting to see what had happened from a convert stand point. I just put aside everything and started focusing on the work and it was amazing how everything came about after that. Of course there are times when the Spirit has been very strong I think when  when I was 14 and prayed about the Book of Mormon before I could even get the words out I just felt the Spirit in my heart just really strong and I just felt so filled with light not everything is like that, but as I read the scriptures or as I hear truths at church then I know it's confirmed to me in my heart that these things are true so your testimony just grows little by little. I had a huge experience overnight that I would say step-by-step led me to where I need to be.  I ended up going on a mission I ended up marrying in the temple. And so like I'm  reading through the Book of Mormon and like you get like that ah ha the thought that these things are true comes to your mind. Peace, joy, overwhelming happiness you know it just kinda like impressed on your soul and the cool thing is it's not something that happens once it's something that happens over, over and over again. Well my first experience that I had goes back to when I was eight years old and I was ready to get baptized. So that morning my mom was finishing the dress that I was going to wear after my baptism. it was a beautiful blue organza. So she is trying to finish my dress so I can have this beautiful dress and I just walked in the sewing room and I asked her "why do I need to get baptized?" and she said "I'm a little busy why don't you go ask Heavenly Father why you need to get baptized." So I went into my room and knelt down and there was this overwhelming experience in which I was not able to finish my prayer so I ran into the sewing room and told my mom "mommy, mommy why I'm I crying so much?" and she told that was the Spirit telling me, making a confirmation that what I was going to do was the right thing to do.This experience has changed my life around from where I used to be it was amazing to feel the Spirit you could say that I was in a mist of darkness, that I didn't necessarily even know where I was, it was all a blur the opportunity arose and I saw a light in a sense and ran towards it as fast as I could.

http://www.mormonchannel.org/power-of-the-holy-spirit 

To have the Spirit with you at all times you have to always have a prayer in your heart,keep your mind pure and always try to have Christ-like standards. For me to have the Spirit with me I need to make sure that I invite the Spirit, following what I know the Savior wants me to do and then I need to have the desire for it to be with me. As far as the Spirit is concerned, learning to understand or know what it is is a process. It is just like learning how to dribble a basketball or learning how to do anything you want to do in life. It's Something you have to work at. I was noticing  many of the prayers that are asked are to allow the Spirit to be here, allow the Spirit to be with us, and that really i think is very important that we ask. I make sure to think about the Savior as much as possible. I have pictures around in my house and in my room and I think those little reminders just help you focus on those things that truly matter in life. I definitely started out each morning praying that I will have the Spirit with me and just trying to find those quiet moments throughout the day. As you pray and as you read the scriptures, and as you read the words of the living prophet, when you go to the temple you feel like your spirit has been fed. there is a constant guidance of what you are doing is the right thing to do. Life just gets so busy and I start realizing you know gosh if I don't have it with me all the time, how can I be expected to do all the things that are thrown at me. It's easy to forget to have the Spirit with you you can feel the difference so much more when you're used to having it and then it's gone. I don't have an answer. I just know when I don't have it it's time to you know start over. Prayer, scriptures you know doing exactly what I need to to have it. I really think that the biggest way to get the Spirit in your life is to read the words of the prophets and apostles that testify of Jesus Christ, to read the words of the Savior and then to live by what they say. That is the biggest thing. You can't just read the word, but not do the deed. You have to live the teachings of Jesus Christ and that means filling your heart with love for your fellow man and striving to have charity and if you do those two things then you will naturally keep all the other commandments.

"And when we find him, will we be prepared as were the wise men of old to provide gifts from our many treasures?" - President Thomas S. Monson

"...They presented gold, frankincense and myrrh. These are not the gifts Jesus asks of us. From the treasure of our hearts Jesus asks that we give of ourselves."" - President Thomas S. Monson

Traveling to their ancestral city of Bethlehem, Mary and Joseph are unable to find a room in an inn. Instead, they find shelter in a place where animals are kept. 

Luke 2: 4-7

4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem ; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 
5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 
6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 
7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn .

The Wise Men present Jesus with gifts—gold, frankincense, and myrrh. After their visit, Mary and Joseph flee to Egypt to protect Jesus from the wicked King Herod, who wishes to kill the child. 

Matthew 2: 1-2, 11-15

1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judæa in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 

11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense , and myrrh. 
12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. 
13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. 
14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: 
15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.

The angel Gabriel, sent from the presence of God, announces to the young Mary her future role as the mother of the child Jesus.

Luke 1: 26-38

26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 
27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 
28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women . 
29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. 
30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 
31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus . 
32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David : 
33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end . 
34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 
35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 
36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. 
37 For with God nothing shall be impossible . 
38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

Mary visits her relative Elisabeth, who in her old age will also soon give birth to a miraculous child. The women rejoice together. 

Luke 1: 39-55

39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; 
40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. 
41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 
42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. 
43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 
45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. 
46 And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord, 
47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour . 
48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed . 
49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name. 
50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. 
51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. 
52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. 
53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. 
54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; 
55 As he spake to our fathers , to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

The angel Gabriel announces the birth of Jesus to the shepherds. The shepherds then visit Mary, Joseph, and the newborn Jesus. 

Luke 2: 8-18

8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people. 
11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord . 
12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 
14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace , good will toward men. 
15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 
16 And they came with haste , and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. 
17 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. 
18 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.

Mary and Joseph take Jesus to the temple, where the righteous Simeon blesses the baby and rejoices that the Lord let him live to see this day. 

Luke 2: 22-38

22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord; 
23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 
24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons. 
25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. 
26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ. 
27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 
28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: 
30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation , 
31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; 
32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. 
33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. 
34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; 
35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. 
36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; 
37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. 
38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
