Allan I wish your car repair shop was in Salt Lake City so I could help 
support your business. Sadly I think I will just have to tell the family 
and friends I have in Logan to bring their cars to you. Such a great story. 
And so true, just like there is life after death, there IS life after 
divorce, or bankruptcy, or the death of a child or anything else terrible 
you can think of. It can and will get better as long as you put your trust 
in the Lord.It's stories like these that make me love the Gospel of Jesus Christ!! I 
believe it, I love it, and I love sharing it!!What a Magnificent turn-around for these two - makes you wanna cryI wish i could like this video. Awesome.This is such an incredible story. This completely re-enforces the doctrine 
that the church teaches that people can change! Come unto Christ and all 
can be forgiven. People can change and if we are doing the right things in 
our lives we can help people to change.A heart warming story of a couple finding love and happiness after making 
mistakes early in their adult lives.That's good cause I think god to for life and he help me tto with stoping 
drankingKnow them both... these guys are awesome!Loved this story. There is life after divorce.A powerful testimony to finding new life after brokennessI grow funny mustaches. :)Very touching. Thanks for your touching story.Father provides miracles in our lives when we live his commandments!"He doesn't look adorable, but he is adorable" I laughed in a pleasant way.Great story, great couple.
