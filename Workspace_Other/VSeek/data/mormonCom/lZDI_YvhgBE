Thank you .. Mrs Judy Brock, I felt bless by your story and know God will 
continue to Bless you all and don't be so hard on yourself .. We are human 
but make errors .. God opens doors .. :)I cannot find the words to adequately tell you how much your story has 
inspired me. Thank you. Thank you for sharing!Never forget that when someone needs the Lord's help, he sends US. 
Beautiful testimony of how small acts of kindness by strangers (the family 
of the boy and the letter writers) can bring solace and peace. We should 
always listen and act on those promptings of the Spirit.What a great story! Another testimony is born by learning how someone else 
overcame earthly challenges.What a wonderful demonstration of trust and courage! Thank you for being 
brave and sharing your experience, Judy.
