That's awesome what you can do with your Harley sculptures. You are a 
pretty cool Mormon!Me encanta su fuerza inspiradora, su poesia y su talento.Nnamdi has shown us with his video that God has blessed each of us with 
many talents that we can use to build a better world.Whatever you can do, do it your best and that is enough. Thank you to each 
of you for all you do. Please feel free to ask for help when ou need it.I love people that do what they love!I love art. Nnamdi Okonkwo's art is so inviting. He says that he loves the 
human spirit in each person (paraphrasing) and that that spirit is what 
inspires him to sculpt. Nnamdi has captured that spirit in his art. He also 
says that he believes that God has given each of us talent that we must 
develop. Everything in Nnamdi Okonkwo's own spirit as reflected in his 
eyes, his smile, his manner and his art tells me that he lives his words. 
Loved this video.I love this video and his sculptures are amazing!! :Dclocked display much ooLove you!neat
