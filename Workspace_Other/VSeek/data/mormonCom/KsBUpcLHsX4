Oh wow! I know her! She is the bishops wife. I served in her ward for 
4months & I absolutely loved that ward. It's so good seeing her & her 
Family still doing well. I still remember your Harusame Sister Nakamura 
they were the best!What a beautiful testimony of the power of music to uplift the soul. I just recently got called to be the Primary Music leader and I love it! 
Music sung by those sweet spirits help strengthen me. Music truly is a gift 
from our Heavenly Father.EXCELENTEThis is a great example of how music can bring peace, comfort and faith. 
I've been blessed to serve as an organist in my ward, and I know how so 
many different songs can touch people's lives. One hymn I love is I Know 
that My Redeemer Lives. It brings the Spirit in so strong and brings peace 
to me. I invite anyone who sees this to read the lyrics and listen to the 
song at LDS.org. It can increase your testimony of Christ.
