Great job Dad!!Some times we have hardships in your lives, and it helps to have faith to 
be able to get though it. I'm a divorce of two husbands and a widow of the 
third of four and a half years of marriage. a car accident took he's life. 
And I'm single mother of one daughter. And I'm a moron. people, older than 12, who misspell "there, their, and they're" annoy the 
every living....crap...out of me. >___< god bless your heartWe are just normal like anybody else, we just have different views when it 
comes to our eternal perspective.Ooh! He's even a great cook! YumI also live in Portland and its a great place to be a Mormon. There are 
enough of us here not to feel lonely, but not enough of us here to dampen 
our appreciation for others differences. I love the line "Man, I'm gonna dig being a grandfather" :)228 people preffer GUCCII really love this video! I'm mormon and I wanna be a fashion designer too.@LegendVaslor Sweet. If that's true for you, seriously keep on rockin it =) 
For me, striving to be those things has everything to do with my religious 
beliefs. It's the helm to my ship, and my stars at night. We have different 
paradigms, and I think think that's pretty cool. I think that this campaign 
is a chance for different people to talk together about life, hopefully, in 
a civil way. peace & love@LegendVaslor these videos are to dispel any steryotypes and myths 
associated with Mormons@LoserDouchebag Mormons are Christians too. Just saying.There are a lot of Mormons in NYC. There is even a temple in Manhattan 
right across from Lincoln Centerhis sons are so cute!@LegendVaslor hahaha there not to show what religion can do for you there 
to show that mormons are normal people haha@cartoonsfut Is it really that hard to figure out.......@Crooklynism I bet he teaches then tolerance for all humans.why does this video have so many dislikes?@Crooklynism I would love an answer to that question lol.
