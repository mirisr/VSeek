I love this videos because shows mormons as ordinary people whom work, live 
and enjoy life, but also  enjoy being members of the church of Jesus Christ 
of latter day saints﻿Very impressive﻿This makes me wonder what more I can do with my life.  Dave has really 
accomplished a lot in a relatively short time.  Great video, thanks﻿
