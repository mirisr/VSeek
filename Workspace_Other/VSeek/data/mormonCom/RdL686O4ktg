what's the opening song? it's awesome!I loved the fact that he shows how life can be fun!anyone knows what song is that at the beginning?It's true, Mormons are just normal people, really happy normal peopleHe shows that being a scientist and religious are not mutually exclusive. I 
like that.You guys dont get it....these videos were made to show the rest of the 
world that mormons are everyday people just like everyone else because the 
world has made up all these assumptions about them....they're everyday 
people just like you and me, thats all they're trying to sayOf peace, love and understanding, it is understanding that is most needed 
in this world as it paves the way for the other two. I am glad to have been 
asked to participate in this media campaign. I love my religion. I love 
people who have many other faiths and some who have no faith at all. 
Education overcomes prejudice. I am not the best bloke around. I am trying 
to be better. My experience of my religion is that it helps me on this 
journey. Peace to you all! Hmmmm. There are Mormons. Cool. I understand. Now keep it in your church.You guys have Mormons. we get it. ;)He's a family man? Where's Guile's Theme?Awesome story loved every part of it, those shots with the seals were 
amazing!I applaud sustainability.
