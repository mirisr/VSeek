Wonderful video; thanks for sharing your life and faith with us Beatta!I love these videos, they always teach me something & lifts me up. I have 
so much admiration for Mothers who work so hard to live on a tighter budget 
so they can be home with their kids. Nobody works harder than stay at home 
Moms!I am a Mac. So there! I'm a photographer and a Mormon.I'm Brandon Campana and I don't advertise my religion.Cut-out part at the end - "Oh, and I also need to realize that religion is 
not for everyone and in nowhere in this video did I explain my religion in 
anyway. p.s. I also need braces."I'm John Cantera And im a human.@SGTProduction Oh boy, I can only imagine what lies people have told you 
about Mormons. They are taught NOT to kill, steal, commit adultery, cheat, 
hurt anyone or anything, etc. They are told to obey the law, be good to 
others and accept everyone. How is this dangerous? They are not a strange 
cult that sacrifices people or animals shedding their blood or whatever the 
heck you think Mormons are. You should do your research first son!MORMONSWow this is soooo exciting! I love this! I really do! She looks like an 
amazing mom. Beatta! I was so excited to run across your videa! It's your old visiting 
teacher, Kenzee, from back in the Logan student ward. I always loved your 
amazing photos, hearing about Finland, and your fabulous sense of 
decorating. Your kids are beautiful. Glad to see that your family is doing 
well. I am Heidi Owen and i am MormonThis mindset isn't rational... At all. Beautiful family and woman. But 
dangerous beliefs.
