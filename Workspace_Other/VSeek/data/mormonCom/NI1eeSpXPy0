Michael! I know him! I served my mission with him! :DGo mormons! :)Who else thinks he looks like a guy out of a movie?How we overcome many times defines us as who we are.@tapion123 I know a lot of these videos have people dealing with trials but 
doesn't everybody? These videos are about what people feel define them and 
often it's our trials that make us who we are (not in a bitter way, but in 
how we've grown from them).@tapion123 maybe you should look when he posted the comment.actually theres 32 dislikes and 23 likes and im starting to see in these 
mormon videos that a lot of there first born sons are disabled and its 
starting to breach the wall of coincidenceWow I really love this. But I accidently gave it a thumbs down :( like the 
other 32 people.
