Would you view the Baptist,Catholic or Atheist videos and make the same 
comments? Or is the Mormon faith what you choose to troll?Just wondering...Lovely, thanks!Mormons are some of the nicest people. Psalms 90:2 "..., or ever thou hadst 
formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou 
art God." According to this verse, how long HAS God been God? Isaiah 44:6 
"I am the first, and I am the last, and beside me there is no God." Isaiah 
44:8 "Is there a God beside Me? Yea, there is no God, I know not any." 
Finally, John 4:24 "God is spirit, and has not flesh and bones." Good Every 
goo Mormon should pray about this. @voyalbonbon The point isn't to show you something just Mormons do. The 
point is to show you the variety of our lives vs the stereotypical view of 
us. Great video, Alexis. Thanks for sharing! That was beautiful, thank you. This can happen with every other religion -___-. You can be Baptist and 
participate in the choir, Catholic, or any other denomination. Hell, you 
could be damn Atheist and still do all this stuff he has done. As Alexis so eloquently described; music is a vehicle for expression and 
sharing soul to soul, and spirit to spirit. Our love for our Savior, our 
love for musical expression, and our love for all that is beautiul and 
light defines us. Our faith in Jesus is our foundation... These videos are 
as much about what defines us as why we are drawn to and find joy in our 
"Mormon" culture. It's all part of one great whole. I think they're great!beautiful music!
