Calling it an ad campaign is a bit of a stretch. These are just as much for 
mormons as they are for everyone else. And what exactly do we not 
understand?thank you :)@peaceliberty4all O.K. I GET U AND ABUT THESE AREN'T MYTHS!!! THESE ARES 
AND THIS IS A TRUE GOSPEL!!!!one in a billion chances in the world/ the lord truly helpsHe has quite a nice collection.this isn't the original video. this has been edited and it leaves out the 
part about how he had to overcome the hardships after 9/11 and did so 
through the Lord. for the original video look for the one posted by 
MormonMessages.Thank you Victor. I used to work on the 80th Floor. I've forgotten about 
the events as much as I can, but this tenth anniversary really hurts. I'm 
LDS as well.@TheGhoulian These videos aren't about sharing what mormons believe but 
dispealing some of the myths about mormons and showing that we are just 
regular people.I absolutely loved this video, so glad you survived. I love that ppl call 
you the honest Lawyer lol. Ppl call my husband the honest realtor. God 
bless.Alright, this is great and all.... But where is Jesus in any of this? Last 
I heard, Christianity was about the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus 
Christ. I've been watching thess videos and the most I've even seen about 
Him is half of a picture of Jesus next to a woman's karate medals. Really?THERE R LIKE 20 OF THESE!@garrettwarz You are the dumbest person alive. @garrettwarz I hope you die.@eloiselovesdevi i down voted because you said to upvoteDon't forget to hit the "like" button on this video ... seems that there 
are a few mormon h8rs with nothing else better to do than go on youtube an 
dislike the church's new "I am a mormon" videos.What is up with this Mormon ad campaign?all of these are really well made! great job!
