I am so thankful for the Gospel. God is good all the time!﻿Wow.  God bless this woman and her children.  I loved her honesty and 
courage.  What an example to all of us.﻿I can only imagine the pain she had to endure as a result of her husband's 
ultimate sacrifice.  She knows she's a beloved daughter of God but had to 
go through the stages of grief to come to terms with her new life.  
Heavenly Father enabled her to do that, to continue to be a loving mother 
to her children and an example to others.﻿A faithful and valiant woman ﻿Very Cool, thank you!﻿
