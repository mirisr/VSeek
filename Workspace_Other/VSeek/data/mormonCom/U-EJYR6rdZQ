I think we should follow that example to share our talents, and have the 
same feeling of a childï»¿she's adorable!Muchisimas gracias por compartir su testimonio. :)It is hard sometimes to be different. To feel that those around you don't 
understand you. That you're alone in the way you live. I feel that way at 
times. Karina Tapia Navas is amazing. What strength, determination, and 
focus. She is a good example. You want to fit in. You want to be 
understood, liked, respected, but all you can do is forget what others 
think and strive to please Heavenly Father. He loves each of us so much and 
He understands. He gets us, He is pleased with us. WOW !! Thanks for sharing your Testimony !!! Gracias por compartir su 
testimonio Hermana !!! :) :)IM A HUMAN, LIGHTWORKER AND SPIRITUAL...es un gran video hermana , la felicito, y siga firme el senor le dara el 
mas grande galardon.
