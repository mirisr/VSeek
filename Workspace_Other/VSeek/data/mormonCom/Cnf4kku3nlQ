My name is Libia Winn. It is a privilege to be a member of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I felt the love and kindness of Felipe. 
He loves the gospel and chooses to be happy despite of his circumstances. 
This is what is life about. We are stronger than our challenges. We can 
choose to complain be miserable or to dance and enjoy life. I am Benjamin Heward. I am a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I am so thankful for the peace, love, and joy that has 
been brought into my life through the restoration of the fullness of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ on this earth. Please see for yourself. Contact 
Missionaries of the Church and allow them to teach you about the amazing 
differences you can have in your life, by learning about, and living 
according to the teachings of Jesus Christ more fully in your life.2nd LDS "I'm a Mormon" video I've seen today in another language other than 
my own and I'm loving it! Don't know what he said, but I read the small 
blurb about the video and also because of the way it was filmed, it is 
evident that he is a cancer survivor. Bless him. I loved this video and 
he's really handsome, too.Wow !
