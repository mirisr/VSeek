Bueno! sorry i wish i knew more of this language but god blesses his 
servants In all their trials when they have faith I pray we may all 
dedicate our self and that I may dedicate my self to the gospel so that as 
stated in general conference the world may see our light and glorify our 
god which in heaven. Hallelujah for people like this! :D ﻿MI MEJOR EJEMPLO ES JESUCRISTO. EL DIJO: "No busco mi voluntad, sino la 
voluntad del Padre". Juan 5:30Es difícil muchas veces confiar en dios y hacer lo que el quiere, pero 
cuando lo hagamos veamos que de verdad no bendecirá de muchas formas. La fe 
obra milagros y sé que dios tiene la mano metido en nuestras cosas 
cotidianasI served as a missionary in Arecibo, Puerto Rico for The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints from Sept 1981 - April of 1982. It is one of my 
favorite places in the world, and I have some of my dearest friends there. 
I saw the Church in its infancy there and now there are so many faithful 
and wonderful members of the Church! I am sure that the Island will be so 
richly blessed having Alex and Nuria back! I love that beautiful place and 
I love these beautiful people!I am curious to know how things have worked out for Alex in finding work in 
PR. I too am a Mormon and am married to a Puerto Rican, so I'm impressed by 
your faith to pack up and move to PR without a job in line. Best of success 
there in PR!
