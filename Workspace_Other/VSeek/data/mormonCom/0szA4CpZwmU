into this 5 senses world by being born into it. Like wise we come into Gods 
world/Kingdom by being Born into it. The first birth is of the flesh the 
second birth is of the Spirit. In the first birth we had no say in the 
second the choice is ours. The first is temporal the second is for ever. In 
the first a human male is our father in the second The Holy Spirit [GOD] is 
our Father.You start by being obedient to Romans 10:9.Glad her God-given heritage helped her find the way through Christ.this is a great voideo..i was really inspired by her education
