I knew Christian when he was studying art in Massa-Carrara Italy. He is one 
of the best people I ever met. I was so pleased to be able to find this 
video and see how he is getting on in life. I'm glad to see that he seems 
so happy because he deserves it.Mormons live all over the world. There are Mormons in Africa, Asia, South 
America, and Europe. It is really worldwide religion.Christian is my hero. What a wonderful example of what a happy family and 
professional life can look like together.i thought mormons were only in Utah, France, and other parts of America
