started out to be a restaurant owner and a chef.I am a momon! And I love it, And im going to be a missionary! :D@imnotaturtle The video was put out by the Mormon Church to show that 
Mormon's aren't a bunch of wierdos that sometimes the media and others 
describe them to be. They are normal everyday people just like you or me.
