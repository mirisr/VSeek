I love it and I know because he lives and love me I can safely say I can be 
with him some day I have to love and keep his commandment﻿That was amazing
﻿I love Jesus.﻿That would be "born-again" Christian...﻿I'm a birn-again Christian, Alzheimers Caretaker and grandmother. This is a 
beautiful reminder that no matter who we are, we can touch others with the 
love and mercy of Christ if we have put our Faith and Belief in Him:)﻿My name is Carmen and Im a Christian.. thank you so much for Posting... 
Jesus Is Risen and lives in our hearts ~﻿The true meaning of Easter! 

-a christian teen. ﻿#BecauseHeLives, I am not giving up on the one I love.. even though.. she 
may never come back, I'll never know if I call it quits today... 🐃💔🐂
Happy Easter, everyone. ﻿#BecauseHeLives I am not afraid of death anymore. We have the opportunity 
to have our sins forgiven, and be resurrected just like him. I used to be 
afraid to tell people about my religion, because I was afraid they wouldn't 
accept me as me. But now if people ask me about my church, I tell them. I'm 
proud to be a Mormon, and you should be proud of your religious beliefs 
too!﻿<3﻿#becuasehelives﻿#BecauseHeLives, I can face tomorrow and know that I am #saved and face all 
things!! Good or bad , easy or tough, I know #helives!!!! He is always in 
our hearts, standing next to us, protecting us in the #Heavens , everywhere 
we go , we can have #Faith!!﻿Today, I watched the 185th general conference of the church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saint s. They talked about this and I canot wexpress my 
gratitude for what he has done for all of us. For those of you who are not 
members, please take another look at this video and think what wou up ld he 
feel if he inew that one of his lost sheep, you, has found it's way back to 
him. I testify that he will e Em brace you and never let you go again. I 
encourage you to talk to members and feel of their happiness and joy that 
comes only by being part of this wonderful restored gospel. And for all, 
may you strive to come unto him and partake of his atonement. He loves you, 
and so do I!!!!﻿We didnt evcen deserve for him to die for us but he did it because he loves 
us that much, and we are his children have a happy easter :)﻿#BecauseHeLives﻿Amen Thank You Jesus. He is RISEN!﻿#BecauseHeLives, I am where I am today, and many others as well. This just 
made my day. ;)﻿Without Easter the world would be in chaos and darkness Jesus death and 
resurrection means we can be reborn to live better to do better to shine 
light in to the shadows halalughia happy happy easter﻿Without Easter there would be no hope for heaven without the hope of heaven 
there would be no repentance no personal transformation no attempt to 
follow biblical principles﻿AMEN ﻿I'm an agnostic atheist, but I have to say I am surprised by the amount of 
kindness in this specific videos comments. On most Christian videos 
everybody in the comments is fighting and ridiculing anyone who disagrees 
with them, happy Easter everybody!﻿I loved the video because it said so much and could touch someone's heart 
if they accidentally come across it.﻿Happy Easter!!﻿#BecauseHeLives  I can one day return to live with Him in Heavenly Father's 
presence.﻿As a Mormon this made me grin ear to ear that this made the front page on 
Easter. It's a message all religions can relate to. Happy easter ﻿This is amazing. This shows why Christianity took place. People have 
unimaginable faith in God and all should. Everyone should have faith, and 
Jesus died for our sins. ﻿Amen 0:)﻿Simply wonderful. ﻿Families are together forever﻿What a beautiful and positive video, glade to see this of the front page of 
YouTube. Happy Easter Everyone.﻿Not being rude but what a Mormon﻿How could anybody dislike this﻿I love how everyone is so open to other people's opinions! It's shows that 
regardless of our different religions, we are all still God's people and He 
is ALL of our Father!
-Happy Easter!!﻿#Becausehelives AMEN!!!﻿Never cease to praise him! Happy eater everyone🙏 (wish I could like this a 
million times)﻿#BecauseHeLives I am here today, and forgiven of my mistakes and sins, and 
loved forever and ever which is the greatest gift of all! ❤️﻿Beautiful ﻿This is very inspiring and i don't even believe in god. Wonderful video the 
quality was unexpected for me. 

Moral of the story: no matter how far down you go, as long as your still 
alive, you can always get back up and keep going.﻿#BecauseHeLives , I am standing to be able to type this today. We all owe 
The Lord Christ our thanks, for had He not saved us from our sins by dying 
on the cross, God would not have forgiven us. It is because of Our Lord 
Christ that we all stand together to worship God and His Son. Let us be 
thankful that we can live our lives knowing that The Lord Christ is 
watching over us, covering us in his blood to protect us from all that is 
not like thee! Let us praise Him and God, for they are worthy of praise! In 
Jesus name we pray, Amen.﻿Thank you Jesus for life, for the precious blood you shed..#Becausehelives
