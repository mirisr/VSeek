I´m a recovered drug and alcohol addict. I overdosed dozens of times and 
hurt so many people. The Gospel and Jesus Christ helped me find the good 
will to change and save my life. I thought that the Lord would never love 
me and would never accept me back in the church... He proved me wrong!!! My 
testimony is that Jesus loves us no matter what we´ve done, and if we 
repent, He loves us even more!!! I thank the Lord for all the blessings He 
gives me everyday.I do cry for my sins. my sins are of drinkingHits very close to home. As I continue on this journey my belief increases 
that the most joy that we can experience is through living as God would 
have us live.We can do hard things.very coolSo touching
