Wow. I'm shocked. I did not know they were Mormon, or  Christian or even 
religious for that matter. I'm more of an agnostic when it comes to 
religion, but I am big on Individual Liberties, so all I can say is props 
to her for having the courage to stand up for her principles. Cheers!﻿That rocks! She is awesome. I loved that she testified of choosing to 
follow Christ, that is not as hard as she thought it was. I loved that her 
band has made the commitment to abstain from drinking, swearing, smoking 
and taking drugs all those things bring people down they are not uplifting 
in anyway. ﻿That so awesome I did not know that! I learn so much on " I am a Mormon" 
videos. Thanks lds.org. I am proud to be lds. ﻿
