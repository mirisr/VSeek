We had the privilege of meeting Lyuba (Love) when she visited our home this 
past Sunday. She's a delightful, amazing young woman with a sincere 
testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ.It's nice to see other people like us on the other side of the world. And 
little extra they believe in Jesus Christ, and are Mormon like me. They 
look happy and are good example for people in there country and ours the 
USA. :) Such wonderful examples to the Russian people, and to us all!
