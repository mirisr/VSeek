So beautiful. I work with children in urban Harrisburg. Bad schools here, 
too, I run a free library out of my house. I am inspired! The light of the 
spirit is so strong in you, thank you sister Garner. Hang in there, all you 
do every minute has eternal life in it. She is beaming, inside and out!
