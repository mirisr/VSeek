Wonderful example of someone who has overcome her obstacle of poverty and 
lack of education in her youth. She now works as a social worker and uses 
that experience to help others who are in similar situations like hers. 
Worth watching.I am Benjamin Heward. I am a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ of
