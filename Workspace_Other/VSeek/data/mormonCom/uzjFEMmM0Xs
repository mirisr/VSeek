your serving the Lords law.  I shared today by helping in giving food and 
gifts to the homeless, people in need and anyone that walked in the door

JESUS is the only way to Heaven. Because of HIS love for us, JESUS 
sacrificed HIMSELF on the cross. Why did JESUS do this? JESUS did this 
because HE wanted to make a way for us to go to Heaven. Thank you, JESUS! 
There would've never been any way for us to live in Heaven without YOUR 
sacrifice!ï»¿Hashtag share the gift! Merry Christmas
