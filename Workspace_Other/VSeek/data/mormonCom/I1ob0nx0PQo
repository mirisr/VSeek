Wonderful video. Thank You :)What an incredibly touching video. Because some people think that professing ones religion equates to pushing 
your beliefs on others. Or, simply, they just have such sad lives that they 
troll YouTube looking for Mormon videos to thumb down.nervous anticipation and setting low expectations to avoid disappointment. 
obviously he really desired them to be smart and beautiful and they are!@GreyWolfLeaderTW Isnt all religion family centered? About love? I loved this video, so sweet and what a beautiful family you have. God 
Bless.@gottwig13 hahaha so they won't have so many guys after them :)@gottwig13 when have beautiful daughters guys are going to try to get with 
them. its a harsh judging world we live in but its true. being unfortunate 
with looks keeps alot of the attention of the opposite sex away from you. 
so as a parent you have less to worry about. plus if there smart they'll go 
somewhere in life@TheOfficialMG Maybe because their religion is so family-centered. The 
basic theological tenant of Mormonism, their explanation for the 
relationship between Man and the Divine is that, "The Lord is our literal 
Spirit Father." Thus, the entire "Metaphysical Drama" of Humanity is that 
of an Eternal Family. That is what being Mormon has to do with this 
beautiful family.He's my brother-in-law!surprise surprise lol screened comments. I like this video...why so many dislikes@TheOfficialMG I think they would say that it has a lot to do with them. 
For myself, being Mormon is very much a part of my identity.what does being a Mormon have to do with this beautiful family?@theimprovpoet I felt the same way it shows the love he has for his country 
and his family. God bless him and his family! This video made me cry...such a sweet family with so much love.
