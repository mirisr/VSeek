Love being mormon:)So great! I loved this one too! MomGood memories of him hurdling players at BYU.What a great story! Go Chad Lewis. You Rock!!! I love when he says "through great challenges great things can happen". Love being mormon!!Seems like a nice guy. Glad to see him and other NFL players out doing some 
good things to help restore confidence in people. What an experience that 
hike must have been! Sad to see the injuries and casualties of war, but 
glad to see people trying to make the most of a bad situation. Thank you for sharing your story with the world! It is truly a great 
measure to your character that you help out with that great charity! What 
an awesome experience!Love this, what a Patriot. Thanks Brother Lewis! Hi Chad, thanks for the great video, and you are right, it's all about 
being close to your family! That makes for the happiest life!!Chad thanks for the great example. Great reminder to give back whenever we 
get the chance? True blue!!Chad, great story. So good to see someone talk about the good that comes 
from giving back. God bless. I'm a mormon too.Great video! Chad is a great athlete and an even better person.Chad, you are such a great guy. Every time I see you talk, you have a huge 
smile on your face. Thanks for being a great example. All the best.
