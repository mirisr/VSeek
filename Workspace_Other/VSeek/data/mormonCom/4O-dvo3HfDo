I am Benjamin Heward. I am a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I am so thankful for the peace, love, and joy that has 
been brought into my life through the restoration of the fullness of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ on this earth. Please see for yourself. Contact 
Missionaries of the Church and allow them to teach you about the amazing 
differences you can have in your life, by learning about, and living 
according to the teachings of Jesus Christ more fully in your life."Soft soil, seen in terms of the heart, has an 'honest feeling' to it." 
This phrase touches me as I realize that living the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
with all my heart, makes my heart 'soft soil'. In that soil can grow more 
truth, more love, and more conviction that Jesus is the Christ and He has 
restored His church to the earth. I am a member of The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am a Mormon! I'm mormon, Afuá - Brasil/Amazônia "If there is anything good, I will accept it and apply it to my character." 
I love that!
