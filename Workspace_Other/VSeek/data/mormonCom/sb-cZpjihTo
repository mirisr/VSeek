Great one. As a coda, son of deaf parents, I was touched by the mom's 
positive attitude. She is right on. ï»¿What a great family! Thank you very much for sharing this video with 
everyone. You are the best!It's great to see parents who know how to communicate with their son. On a 
mission many deaf children we taught weren't so lucky to have as dedicated 
parents as these ones. Great job and thank you so much for your great 
example!!!I love this video! Thank you to this family for sharing their testimony of 
Christ!Georgia Peach. I must say that your peaches are absolutly the best ever I
