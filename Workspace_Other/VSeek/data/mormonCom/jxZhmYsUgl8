meant to convert you, but to show you that Mormons are a diverse group of 
people. Butch is one cool guy!The landscape looks like the area my parents are going to be serving while 
on their mission. They were called to serve in the south island on the east 
side, where all the farmland is. They are leaving in 2 weeks. Maybe they

aren't weird like what the world thought but they are people like you and 
me going with their daily chores with their life PLUS willing to serve 
others at any given time 24/7.@RontoTheDog The point of this video is to show that Mormons are normal 
people too. :)What does his religion have to do with his job? :|Thank you for sharing your story, Brother Horsford. Greetings from Fresno,
