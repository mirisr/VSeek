Mormon.org can tell you more! ;)Great video!I ain't the only Mormon cowboy. I can't wait to serve soon.I like your video. Thanks for sharing.Love bein' mormonI have watched them have 5 or more children, all turn out excellent, have a 
wondeful career, nice home, nice garden and do loads of church work. I have 
witnessed it since my joining the church. I've never understood how you do 
that. I think I needed to live inside one of their homes. It's more than 
just trying to teach principles. It's a structure I don't know. mormon are smiling face.good.ihope one day i also became mormon. A Cowboy Christian. My kind of Guy!!! I hope one day I'm hard working like him.5 girls!! need a great dad like yougreat video Most mormons that I know have a really strong work ethic like this guy. In 
fact, there is a whole website about taking care of yourself and your 
family called provident living.
