Lets be a good example for the others as a mormonï»¿I love to see the different members share their testimony of Jesus Christ 
through their everyday life. I love our Savior Jesus Christ and the 
restoration of His true and complete gospel on the earth today. I feel so 
blessed, as this man does :) I am Benjamin Heward. I am a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I am so thankful for the peace, love, and joy that has 
been brought into my life through the restoration of the fullness of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ on this earth. Please see for yourself. Contact 
Missionaries of the Church and allow them to teach you about the amazing 
differences you can have in your life, by learning about, and living 
according to the teachings of Jesus Christ more fully in your life.Subtitles! Between the quality and annotation options on the bottom right
