"Life wouldn't be realistic without trials. And instead of avoiding trials, 
we should embrace them." I loved those words that he shard with us!!!﻿"Rather than avoid challenges, I think we should embrace them."
Great lesson!﻿when you work in something that you really love, you are not really working!This is something I'd like to do in my free time. What a great story about 
hard times and doing what is right.:DThat sounds like so much fun. You can live your dreams while living a 
balanced life.
