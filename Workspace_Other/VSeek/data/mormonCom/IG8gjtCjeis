You might be surprised... Some of my ex-companions were: boxing 
southamerican champion, esgrima national Champion, surfers, hard rock 
musicians, paragliders, dentists, maths weirdos, and nerds like me.... "I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his 
creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who 
is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the 
individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor 
such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotism." ----Albert Einsteinyea I get it, your all normal people... so for the love of god stop hitting 
me over the head with the adds! @ivanwarlord LOL. There are a lot of things we mormons do. If everyone 
follows your example the world will stop turning :)) Enjoy your day. Your 
joke made me smile. so....your saying...along with every other mormon out there, that BECAUSE 
you are mormon you can climb a mountain? I'm agnostic and I'm sending this 
comment on top of Mt Rainier, Camp Mur. Hm...what's god..oh sorry..joseph 
smith, pro rock climber. A non-Catholic Frenchman? I'm shocked. Too bad he fall for a further west 
joke! :-)I'm confused. Is this trying to show that mormons are people to?i bet the mormons that walked up to my garage yesterday don't climb.i give 10% of my income to thor. He is building apartments and a mall in 
downtown Olympus.@Creeperman35 I don't understand how this is pushing the religion on you. 
These videos are here for people who are interested in watching, not to 
force people to watch...@Creeperman35 No one is push you to be Mormon your the one that came to the 
video.great i used to love rock/lead climbing but now that i see that a mormon 
does it to i quit :(The Frenchie surrendered to Mormonism.. Just like the French did in 1940."Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, 
and those who matter don't mind." â€” Theodor Seuss Geisel Looks like a fun man.je vous aimez tous!
