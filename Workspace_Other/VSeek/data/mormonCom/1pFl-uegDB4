 Thanks for the video, very, very inspiring!!ï»¿I was so delighted to see your video - I was baptised in 2006 and am now a 
high priest. When I was a teenager I earned a diploma from the Northwestern 
School of Taxidermy; however, after surviving as a machine gunner in 
Vietnam and knowing I was going to die, my dream of taxidermy died with me. 
I was happy to see you have completed my dream in taxidermy.I am a guy Who Lives In Los Angeles.. Uh Did EVERYTHING.. an avid Gamer..

time. I CHOSE to get baptized a Mormon. I have never been happier. it's a 
choice.. its up to you I am Benjamin Heward. I am a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ of
