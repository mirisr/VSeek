I am Benjamin Heward. I am a Member of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. I am so thankful for the peace, love, and joy that has 
been brought into my life through the restoration of the fullness of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ on this earth. Please see for yourself. Contact 
Missionaries of the Church and allow them to teach you about the amazing 
differences you can have in your life, by learning about, and living 
according to the teachings of Jesus Christ more fully in your life.His happy face is like the light of christ, every easily seen! I didn't understand a word he said. For some reason, I still enjoyed it. 
His happiness is contagious.I'M a Mormon too from the Philippines! One good thing to all Mormons is 
that our church leaders are leading us towards the reigning of our Great 
King! our Savior Jesus Christ, where there will be one world, one earth, 
one culture and one nation! without political boundaries! In the end, we 
will be in his presence as brothers and sisters :)
