What a beautiful testimony. Thank you for sharing this! Sounds like they were all baptised from what he said starting from 1:29. 
His son's friends asked his son "What happen your family when you were 
baptised" implies that they were baptised as a family.I wish it was more clear on whether or not his wife and son also joined, he 
doesn't mention it. But I think it's wonderful for him that it changed him 
and helped his family!I can't believe that this does not have more views! This is a cool story 
that breaks down a lot of stereotypes about mormons. Even someone who works 
at Harvard can find meaning from this religion.
