Abuse kills hope for so many, your story gives hope to the hopeless. I love 
your strength and willingness to share. It's for the people tht don't understand we're people too. The people that 
think we are all robots who march to the same drum and don't have a 
personality.Thank you thought I was the only one that felt this way as a single mom.@dignan1000 I Like your comment she s struggling in the world and her 
religion meets her needsI am learning about a bunch of individuals who also happen to be Mormon. 
I'm not learning anything about MORMONISM, per se, through these videos.the purpose of these videos is to introduce the world to a typical 
selection of members of the LDS faith. There have been a lot of misnomers 
about Mormons, I have met several people who thought that Mormons were 
Amish; this is a way for the world to learn about us, who we are. I know 
first hand that these ads have made a tremendously positive effect. Thanks 
for your comment/question!!there is none....that's the point.and here you are watching these videos lol.Don't see why there needs to be a channel for a religion."Im a mormon.." And I'm a PC.See our nation needs less religous bounders. Like creating a channel called 
Mormon and not to expect bad comments. I my self am an athiest and think 
that people take their religon to seriously. I know that sounds bad at 
first but when do the bounderys of religon fall under the bounderys of 
science. I think this was a great story but would get more positive feed 
back if they didn't include religon to geatly. But that is just my 
opinion...Wait is this the religion that believes that a tribe from Israel went on a 
boat from the Mediterranean to California? Thats totally logical. Right?I love this story!nice story, but whats the point?? I know that mormons are people too.... 
didn't need a youtube channel to tell me that.If I become mormon can I become a teacher?Not into the Mormon thing, but amazing story.
