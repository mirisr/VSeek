Reasons why I love being a LDS. :DThe exciting moment when you saw your biology professor in a youtube video.Seems like a neat guy. It would have been fun to have him as a teacher. I 
like how he is a geneticist and also that he believes in God. It is not 
mutually exclusive.coolest mormon EVER!!! haha Wow, truly inspirational. I can totally relate to this eco-friendly father 
of 3. I have kids of my own and I swim all the time! lol! I am going to get 
inducted into this "Mormon" culture asap! Well, gotta run!Holy Smokes!!! This guy is in my ward hahaha saw the thumbnail and went 
hmmmm he looks familiar lolThis man is is awesome! This is amazing, alot of people think we (Mormons) just sit around all day 
doing nothing. Me and a friend Had a Argument about the next US president. 
He doesn't want Romny too win because he thinks he wont work on Sundays. 
I'm like. Dude Just because were Mormon don't mean we Can't work on 
Sundays, We believe that its the lords day, to worship him. ever heard of 
something called, On call? I believe Romny would work On Sundays, Because 
He has a duty. and he would still keep Sabbath day holy.Here's a guy I can really relate to!Awesome! I love nerds. Part nerd myself.
