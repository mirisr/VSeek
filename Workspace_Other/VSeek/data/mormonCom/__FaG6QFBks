God works is glorious and mysterious ways but no matter how difficult our 
trials he always provides a way to overcome that is how much he and his son 
loves us God bless you Richard and God bless all of us!﻿... thanks Mathew.I has the privilege of working with Richard. He was a role model as an 
officer and he is a role model as a human being.No one can do everything. But everyone can do something.Love the comment he made- once the fear is taken away, you can do it with 
anything!... thank you for your message ... as I said in my story, once I had 
conquered the fear, then I could face whatever my illness was going to 
throw at me ... stay strong, stay hopeful, stay prayerful ... you’re in my 
thoughts. Thanks for sharing your story. I was diagnosed with PC last november and 
currently having both radiotherapy and hormone threapy . Some days are 
great others not so but I always ask my god to guide me and protect my 
family. With him and through him all things are possible.Thank you for sharing this very touching story of courage and faith. I 
think that if we put our trust in the Savior we can all overcome many 
trials.Thank you for sharing your story Richard!! My father is a retired police 
officer as well and I believe he went through some of those same feelings. 
Thank you for sharing your faith with the world. :)very good Brother This is exactly what I needed to see today. I was having a rough day and 
happened to watch this video & it spoke exactly to what I needed to see. 
Thanks for creating & uploading this.I am just now getting ready to graduate and become a school teacher. I 
thought about what it would be like to retire and suddenly not have a 
professional life after years of service and I thought to myself, how 
grateful I am for the gospel of Jesus Christ that tells us who we really 
are. We learn that we are children of God and have an eternal purpose. 
Thank you for this video.you're the man bishop! xx
