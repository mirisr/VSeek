It is wonderful to know that when we are confused about where we should go 
or what we should do, we can pray. If we even have a tiny bit of faith, God 
will answer our prayers. I like how Mark did just that to know what career 
to pursue. I know God answers prayers.Win...! 2:20 Mormon architecht using SketchUp. My favorite CAD softwarePretty cool! Hopefully my uncle would like this! He's an architect and a
