"I am the mother of two earthquakes." I love it! So cute and sweet!This video is very inspiring and cool. These people come from very humble 
circumstances, but they are actively doing something to create a better 
life for themselves. And they have done this through embracing the gospel 
and living the teachings of Jesus Christ.i liked the up beat and happy family life. The love and happiness expressed 
is very refreshing. Thanks for the great example.
