Mother's Day celebrates moms who gave us life and taught us how to live. This Mother's Day and every day after let's remember it was mom that brought us into this world, it was mom that cared for us and it was mom who showed us what love is and can be. Motherhood truly is a gift. Both to those who have the privilege of being Mothers and to those who have the privilege of having moms.
