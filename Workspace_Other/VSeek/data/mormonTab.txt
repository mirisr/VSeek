Algunos portaron armas, otros cargaron artículos médicos. Ya sea en tierra, en el aire, en el mar, todos cuantos hayan estado dispuestos a servir a su país ven en ello un gran y sagrado honor de proteger, salvaguardar y fortalecer la tierra a la que aman.

El ex Presidente de Estados Unidos George W. Bush dijo: “Vivimos en libertad porque cada generación ha producido patriotas prestos a servir en una causa mayor que ellos mismos. Los que sirven hoy ocupan su merecido lugar entre las generaciones de valientes que han vestido el uniforme de la nación”.

Toda generación tiene la oportunidad de ser tan grande como la anterior. Medimos el valor del servicio de un soldado no por la duración o el escenario del conflicto, sino por el corazón y el carácter de ese ser humano. Cada vez que ellos responden al llamado del deber, tienen la oportunidad de dejar un legado de honor a quienes les seguirán.

Como lo hacen los héroes típicos, ellos dirán: “Apenas hago mi trabajo”, o “Es un honor servir”. No anhelan ser puestos en un pedestal, sino que se ven a sí mismos como hombres y mujeres comunes y corrientes dispuestos a dar todo de sí a su patria. Mas es precisamente esa humilde dedicación lo que llena el corazón con agradecimiento y respeto por su servicio. Ellos son resplandecientes reflejos y claros símbolos de la tierra que amamos.

Otro ex presidente, John F. Kennedy, declaró: “Una nación se manifiesta a sí misma no sólo por los seres que produce, sino por aquellos a quienes honra y recuerda”. Hoy y siempre, recordemos con gratitud a nuestros dignos combatientes y pidamos que las bendiciones del cielo les acompañen.

Alguns prestaram o serviço na linha de fogo; outros, nos bastidores. Alguns carregaram armas; outros, uma maleta médica. Seja em terra, no mar ou na água, todos os que de bom grado atenderam ao apelo para servir a seu país, o veem como um alto e sagrado chamado de proteger, salvaguardar e fortalecer a terra que amam. 

O ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos, George W. Bush observou: “Vivemos em liberdade porque cada geração produziu patriotas com o desejo de servir a uma causa maior do que eles mesmos. Aqueles que servem hoje estão tomando seu lugar entre as maiores gerações que vestiram o uniforme de nossa nação.” 

Cada geração tem a oportunidade de ser tão grande quanto aquela que a precedeu. Medimos o valor do serviço de um veterano não pela duração ou localização do conflito, mas pelo coração e caráter dos soldados. Sempre que eles atendem ao chamado do dever, eles têm a responsabilidade de deixar um legado de honra para aqueles que o seguirão. 

Como típicos heróis, a maioria poderia dizer: “Estou apenas fazendo meu trabalho” ou “Senti-me honrado em servir”. Eles não querem ser colocados em um pedestal ou venerados à distância. Eles se veem como homens e mulheres comuns que apenas desejavam cumprir seu dever e servir a seu país. E é esse senso de humilde dedicação ao dever que enche nosso coração de agradecimento e respeito por seus serviço. Eles são reflexos brilhantes e símbolos visíveis da terra que amamos. 

Outro presidente dos Estados Unidos, John F. Kennedy, disse sabiamente: “Uma nação se revela não apenas pelos homens que produz, mas também pelos homens a quem honra, os homens a quem relembra.” Hoje e para sempre, nos lembremos com gratidão dos homens e mulheres dignos que serviram e oremos pelas bênçãos celestiais sobre eles.

Some spent their military service in the line of fire; others gave their service behind the scenes. Some carried weapons; some carried a medical bag. Whether on the ground, in the air, or on the water, all who willingly respond to the call to serve their country see it as a high and holy calling to protect, safeguard, and strengthen the land they love. 

Former United States President George W. Bush observed: “We live in freedom because every generation has produced patriots willing to serve a cause greater than themselves. Those who serve today are taking their rightful place among the greatest generations that have worn our nation’s uniform.” 

Every generation has the opportunity to be as great as the one that preceded it. We measure the value of a veteran’s service not by the length or the location of the conflict but by the heart and character of the soldiers. Every time brave soldiers respond to the call of duty, they have the opportunity to leave a legacy of honor for those who follow.

Like typical heroes, most would say, “I’m just doing my job” or “It was my honor to serve.” They don’t want to be placed on a lofty pedestal or adulated from afar. They see themselves as regular men and women who were simply willing to step up, do their duty, and serve their country. And yet it’s that sense of humble dedication to duty that swells our hearts with appreciation and respect for their service. They are shining reflections and visible symbols of the land we love. 

Another U. S. President, John F. Kennedy, wisely said, “A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.” This day and forever, let us remember with gratitude our worthy servicemen and women and pray for heaven’s blessings upon them.

Hearing even a simple expression of gratitude can inspire us to do our best. 

That’s what researchers at the London School of Economics found as they analyzed more than 50 studies that looked at what motivates employees in the workplace. Their conclusion? It’s not the paycheck. Along with the sense that our work is meaningful and interesting, the best motivation, they found, comes when someone appreciates what we’re doing. As one expert put it: “Your raise in pay feels like your just due, your bonus gets spent, your new title doesn’t sound so important once you have it. But the sense that other people appreciate what you do sticks with you.”

So why do we sometimes not give others the appreciation they deserve? Some may feel it makes them appear less powerful, less in charge. Others might feel that it goes without saying—a job well done is expected, and thanks should be reserved for only the most exceptional cases. Some people express appreciation only if they think it will get them something in return. And then there are those who just don’t even think about it.

But there are also those who do think to say thank you. For example, recently a hard-working employee received a note of appreciation from his boss. It didn’t come at an annual review. It wasn’t a tactic to get the employee to work harder. It was unexpected, sincere, and timely. It came from a thoughtful leader who simply took a few moments to acknowledge someone’s dedicated efforts. That employee went back to work with a renewed desire to do even better.
 
Sincere appreciation is always appropriate, always needed, and always well worth the effort. Think how much you value the people in your life who express gratitude; they tend also to be optimistic—they are more apt to see the positive in people and situations. When offering appreciation becomes our way of life, it changes the way we see the world, and we come to notice the good things and good people around us.

Episode 4489. Aired September 27, 2015.*NewVideo*Una nota de agradecimiento - Palabras de Inspiración**SzMt5RCelgY**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SzMt5RCelgY/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Todos queremos sentirnos valorados y que nuestros esfuerzos sean reconocidos. Hasta una sencilla expresión de gratitud puede inspirarnos a dar lo mejor de nosotros.

A esa conclusión se llegó en la Facultad de Economía de Londres tras analizar 50 estudios realizados para ver qué es lo que motiva a la gente en su empleo. Ciertamente no es la paga. Además de sentir que lo que hacemos es importante e interesante, se descubrió que la motivación mayor en todos nosotros es escuchar a alguien reconocer lo que estamos haciendo. Como alguien dijo: “Un aumento de sueldo es parte de un acuerdo, un aguinaldo se gasta y una promoción pierde importancia con el tiempo, pero el reconocimiento por lo que hacemos jamás se desvanece”.

Entonces, ¿por qué a veces no reconocemos a otras personas como lo merecen? Hay quienes piensan que eso nos disminuye, o que no hay necesidad de expresarlo ya que eso es lo que se espera, y que el reconocimiento se debe reservar para casos excepcionales. También están los que expresan agradecimiento o reconocimiento sólo si piensan que recibirán algo a cambio, y después están aquellos que ni siquiera piensan en ello.

Pero también hay personas que sí piensan en dar las gracias. Por ejemplo, recientemente un empleado esforzado recibió una nota de agradecimiento de su jefe. No fue durante la evaluación anual ni tampoco una táctica para lograr más rendimiento de él, sino que fue algo inesperado y sincero de parte de un superior que dedicó unos minutos para reconocer el esfuerzo de alguien más. Esa persona volvió a su trabajo con redoblados deseos de ser aún mejor.

El reconocimiento sincero es siempre apropiado y necesitado, y siempre vale la pena el esfuerzo de darlo. Piense en cuánto valora a las personas que expresan gratitud; ellas tienden a ser optimistas y más propensas a ver lo positivo en los demás. Cuando el dar reconocimiento pasa a ser parte de nuestra naturaleza, cambia nuestro modo de ver el mundo y llegamos a ver todo lo bueno que hay a nuestro alrededor.

Ao ouvirmos, mesmo que seja uma simples expressão de gratidão, somos inspirados a ser melhores.

Esta foi a conclusão que peaquisadores da Escola de Economia de Londres chegaram após analizarem mais de 50 estudos sobre o que motiva as pessoas que trabalham. Qual foi a conclusão? Não era o salário. Juntamente com o sentido de que nosso trabalho é importante, veio também o fato de as pessoas admirarem o que fazemos. Um entendido no assunto disse: “O aumento de salário parece ser merecido, o bonus no final do ano é gastado e o novo título após recebido não é tão importante. Mas a satisfação de que outros admirem o que fazemos, é permanente.

Então, porque as vezes não damos aos outros o reconhecimento merecido? Alguns pensam que isso seja um sinal de fraqueza, que não estamos em controle. Outros acreditam que um trabalho bem feito não é mais do que um dever, e que um “obrigado” deve ser reservado para situações excepcionais. Alguns acreditam que expressões de gratidão devem ser dadas quando podemos receber algo em troca. Outros nunca o fazem.

Mas existem aqueles que o fazem. Por exemplo, recentemente um funcionário exemplar recebeu uma nota de agradecimento de seu chefe. Ela não veio durante sua avaliação anual. Não foi uma tática para fazê-lo trabalhar mais. A sincera nota veio de maneira inesperada e no momento certo. Seu chefe, apenas tomou conhecimento dos esforços dedicados de alguém. O funcionário retornou ao trabalho com um renovado desejo de melhorar ainda mais.

Expressões sinceras de admiração nunca caem de moda e são sempre bem vindas. Pense no quanto você valoriza aqueles em sua vida que demonstram gratidão pelo que faz; eles geralmente são otimistas e tendem a ver o positivo nos outros. Quando a valorização se torna parte de nossa vida, ela muda como observamos o mundo fazendo com que notemos as coisas boas, e as pessoas maravilhosas ao nosso redor.

Most people would probably not try to squeeze in one more day at the office or one last television program. More than likely, you would spend most of the day trying to reach the people who are dear to you, simply to say, one last time, “I love you.”

Those three words—I love you—are perhaps the most important words in our language. Of course, they mean something only if they are backed up by authenticity and actions. But the words themselves are important too. So many people go through the day or week or even the year and rarely hear those three simple words. We all need to know that we are loved, that we matter to someone, that we have a place in another’s heart. This is what gives us confidence to face the cold world; it is what makes us feel alive.

How many relationships could begin to heal with a sincere expression of love? How many broken hearts could start to mend? How many marriages or families could be strengthened by the intentional choice to say—both in deeds and in words—“I love you”? 

Perhaps we think our loved ones surely must know how we feel about them. But they need to hear it. Flowery, poetic, or lengthy language is not necessary. Those three simple words are usually just enough.

Their power lies in their straightforward purity. “I love you” includes no caveats, no conditions, no limitations. It gives no explanation or justification. It simply declares to one heart what another heart feels.

When the end of our life does come, we may feel some regret about the things we didn’t accomplish or the goals we didn’t achieve, but we will never regret our expressions of genuine love. So why wait for our final day? Tell someone, “I love you” today.

Muchas personas tal vez tratarían de darse un gusto personal que hasta ese momento nunca habían podido cristalizar. Pero casi por seguro, usted intentaría comunicarse una última vez con cada uno de sus seres queridos para sencillamente decirles, “te amo”.

Esas dos palabras, “te amo”, son, quizá, las más importantes en nuestro idioma. Claro que tienen significado sólo si van acompañadas de sinceridad y hechos, pero las palabras en sí son también importantes. Muchas son las personas que rara vez oyen esas dos sencillas palabras. Todos necesitamos saber que se nos ama, que alguien se interesa en nosotros, que ocupamos un lugar en el corazón de otra persona. Esto es lo que nos da la confianza para hacer frente a este mundo tan insensible; es lo que nos hace sentir ansias de vivir.

¿Cuántas relaciones o corazones dañados podrían sanar con una expresión sincera de afecto? ¿Cuántos matrimonios o familias se verían fortalecidos al oírse en su seno —tanto en hechos como en palabras— tal sincera manifestación de amor?

Quizá pensemos que nuestros seres queridos ya saben cómo nos sentimos hacia ellos; pero es importante que lo oigan de nuestros labios. No es necesario usar lenguaje rebuscado; sólo basta con esas dos sencillas palabras.

La fuerza de ellas se basa en su franca pureza. Un “te amo” no está sujeto a salvedades, condiciones ni limitaciones; no requiere explicación ni justificación. Simplemente declara a un corazón lo que otro corazón siente.

Cuando lleguemos al fin de nuestra vida tal vez sentiremos pesar por las cosas que no hicimos o las metas que no logramos, pero nunca lamentaremos nuestras expresiones de amor genuino. Entonces, ¿por qué esperar hasta ese último día? Diga a alguien “te amo”, hoy.

A maioria das pessoas não iria trabalhar ou assistir televisão. Provavelmente você usaria a maior parte do dia tentando encontrar seus entes queridos e, pela última vez, dizer “eu te amo.”

Essas três palavras, eu te amo, são talvez as mais importantes no nosso vocabulario. É claro elas só tem significado se forem edificadas sobre as boas ações. Mas essas palavras por sí proprias também são importantes. Muitas pessoas passam o dia, a semana ou até mesmo anos sem ouvi-las. Todos precisamos saber que somos amados, que somos importantes, que temos um lugar especial no coração de alguém. Isso é o que nos trás confiança para enfrentar esse mundo tão frio, é o que nos faz sentir vivos.

Quantos relacionamentos poderiam ser curados com sinceras expressõe de amor? Quantos corações quebrados poderiam ser remendados? Quantos casamentos e familias poderiam ser fortalecidos pela decisão de mostrar amor tanto em palavras com em ações?

Talvez pensemos que aqueles a nossa volta saibam que os amamos. Mas eles precisam ouvi-lo. Não é necessário falar de maneira florida, poética ou fazer grandes declarações de amor. As três palavras são suficientes.

O poder delas esta na sua pureza. “Eu te amo” não tem restrições, condições ou limitações. Elas não dão explicação ou justificação. Elas simplismente declaram ao coração de outros os sentimentos do nosso.

Ao chegarmos no final de nossa vida, talvez sintamos remorso pelas coisas não cumpridas ou metas não alcançadas, mas nunca nos sentiremos culpados pelas sinceras expressões de amor. Então, porque esperar pelo último dia? Diga a alguém, “eu te amo” hoje.

Studies have shown that writing about our personal experiences can improve our mood and even our physical health. 

But perhaps one of the greatest benefits of writing about our lives is expressed in this statement attributed to author Bernard deVoto: “The best reason for putting anything down on paper is that one may then change it.” Writing our personal story not only helps us understand that story better, it can also impel us to make the story better. After all, as any good English teacher will tell you, the most important part of the writing process is rewriting.

For example, married couples who wrote about a conflict in their marriage were able to better identify what they could do to make positive changes and strengthen their relationship. Similarly, struggling college students who were invited to write an essay or make a video to explain the rigors of college life to future students ended up with better grades the next semester than those who did not take part in documenting their experiences. Examples like these have led researchers to conclude that “by writing and then editing our own stories, we can change our perceptions of ourselves and identify obstacles that stand in the way of better health.”

Nobody’s book of life is quite ready for publication yet. We’re all rough drafts for now. The process of writing and revising our life story, one that is authentic and real, gives us a chance to reframe the past even as we look forward to a brighter future.

Los estudios demuestran que escribir sobre nuestras experiencias puede mejorar nuestro estado de ánimo y hasta la salud física.

Pero quizá uno de los mayores beneficios de escribir sobre nuestra vida sea el que dijo un famoso historiador: “La mejor razón para escribir cualquier cosa es que después la podemos cambiar”. El escribir nuestra historia personal no sólo nos ayuda a entenderla mejor, sino que puede impulsarnos a hacerla mejor. Después de todo, como se lo diría cualquier buen profesor de la lengua española, la parte más importante del proceso de escribir es reescribir.

Por ejemplo, una pareja que escribió sobre un conflicto matrimonial llegó a identificar mejor lo que podrían hacer para realizar cambios positivos en su relación. Asimismo, unos universitarios a quienes se les pidió que escribieran o produjeran un video que explicara a futuros estudiantes los rigores de esa etapa, terminaron sacando mejores calificaciones en el siguiente semestre que aquellos que no habían documentado sus experiencias. Todo esto lleva a los expertos a concluir que al escribir y editar nuestra historia personal, podemos cambiar percepciones propias e identificar obstáculos que nos privan de gozar de una salud mejor.

Nadie tiene su libro de la vida ya listo para ser publicado. Por el momento, contamos apenas con borradores. El proceso de escribir y reescribir nuestra historia personal de un modo auténtico nos permite reestructurar el pasado y aspirar a un futuro más luminoso.

Outros chamam de expressar nossas experiencias ou criar uma auto biografia. Não importa como chamamos, o importante é que algo acontece ao tomarmos tempo para ponderar sobre  nossa vida e escrever sobre quem somos, nossas aspirações e metas para o futuro. Estudos indicam que escrever as experiências pessoais melhoram o nosso humor e até mesmo nossa saúde física.

Mas talvez um dos maiores benefícios de escrever sobre nossas vidas é expressada nesta declaração do autor Bernard de Voto: "a melhor razão para escrever é que podemos mudar o que foi escrito." Escrever nossa história não só nos ajuda a compreende-la melhor, mas também pode impelir-nos a torná-la mais positiva. Afinal, como qualquer bom professor de Português sabe, a parte mais importante do processo de escrever é reescrever.

Por exemplo, casais que escreveram sobre um conflito em seu casamento puderam identificá-lo e fazer as mudanças necesarias para fortalecer seu relacionamento. Da mesma forma, universitários que foram convidados a escrever uma redação ou fazer um vídeo para explicar os rigores da vida estudantil para os futuros alunos acabaram recebendo melhores notas do que aqueles que não documentaram suas experiências. Exemplos como esses levaram pesquisadores a concluir que "ao escrever e revisar nossas próprias histórias, podemos mudar nossa auto-percepção e identificar os obstáculos no caminho."

Nenhum livro da vida está pronto para ser publicado. Toda história, neste momento é apenas um rascunho. O processo de escrever e revisar a nossa história, autêntica e verdadeira, nos dá a oportunidade de reformular o passado, embora ansiosos para um futuro melhor.

But beautiful things can happen even on ugly days, and often those beautiful things happen when we find a way to make someone smile.

It usually doesn’t take much. Even a small spark of light can brighten someone’s darkness. A kind word of appreciation or encouragement, a cheerful greeting, a sincere compliment, an invitation to join your circle of friends or even just your conversation—these simple gestures cost you nothing and yet can be a great gift. The key is that they point our hearts toward others rather than ourselves.

So much of our daily life is centered on self—our needs, wants, demands, and responsibilities. That’s needful, but it need not be all consuming. Perhaps we could benefit from looking less in the mirror and more into the hearts of others. That may not mean traveling overseas on a humanitarian mission, however worthy that may be. More often, it simply means that we open our hearts to others. It may take practice, and it certainly takes some effort, but generosity of spirit can become a habit of the heart, a way of life. 

Sometimes it’s tempting to assume that the happiest people are those with the most prosperity or the fewest troubles. But of course that isn’t true. That person you know who seems to be unfailingly happy surely has had her share of heartache and difficulty. Her life hasn’t been easy or perfect, and some days are better than others. She’s just decided that those hard time will not be her focus. Instead, she focuses on making other people smile. She made kindness a choice, and it’s become a habit. She’s happy because she is determined to make other people happy. 
Ultimately, self-centeredness is such a lonely place to be. So if you seek for more love and beauty in your life, spread some around in other people’s lives first. Make someone smile today, and without fail, you’ll find yourself smiling too.

Generalmente no requiere mucho. Hasta una chispa de luz puede iluminar un alma oscura. Una palabra de aprecio o de ánimo, un saludo cordial, un reconocimiento sincero, el acercarnos a alguien que está solo o abrumado, son todos gestos que no nos cuestan nada y que al mismo tiempo pueden ser obsequios de gran valor. La clave está en dirigir el corazón hacia otras personas en vez de hacia uno mismo.

Es mucho de lo que nos preocupamos en el diario vivir—necesidades, anhelos, demandas y deberes. Todo eso es necesario pero no hay razón para que nos consuma. Tal vez debiéramos mirarnos menos en el espejo y más en el corazón ajeno. Esto no implica que viajemos a lugares lejanos en una misión humanitaria, sino que a menudo basta con abrir el corazón a los demás. Tal vez requerirá paciencia y esfuerzo, pero la generosidad de espíritu puede volverse un hábito del alma.

A veces llegamos a suponer que las personas más felices son aquellas con más prosperidad o con menos problemas, pero no es así. Ese alguien a quien usted conoce, a quien se le ve continuamente feliz, seguramente pasará por momentos de dolor y prueba. Su vida no es fácil ni perfecta y algunos días son mejores que otros, pero esa persona decidió que su vida no se centra en la adversidad, sino en tratar de hacer sonreír a los demás. Ha decidido irradiar bondad y eso se ha vuelto un hábito en él o ella, y es feliz pues tiene la determinación de hacer felices a otros.

Al fin de cuentas, el egocentrismo trae mucha soledad. Entonces, si queremos que haya más amor y belleza en nuestra vida, antes compartamos esas cosas con los demás. Hagamos a alguien sonreír hoy, y veremos que, indefectiblemente, también nosotros sonreiremos.

Mas coisas maravilhosas ocorrem mesmo em dias difíceis, e elas vem ao fazermos alguém sorrir.  
Normalmente isso não requer muito esforço,uma pequena centelha de luz pode iluminar a escuridão. Uma palavra de agradecimento ou incentivo, uma saudação alegre, um elogio sincero, um convite a um estranho para fazer parte do seu círculo de amigos ou até mesmo de sua conversa, podem ser um grande presente. Estes simples gestos não custam nada. A chave é que eles direcionam nossos corações a outros ao invés de nós mesmos.

Grande parte da nossa vida é auto- centralisada — nas necessidades, desejos, demandas e responsabilidades do dia-a-dia. Isto é importante, mas não precisamos ser por elas consumidos. Podemos nos beneficiar melhor se olharmos menos no espelho e mais nos que nos rodeiam. Isso não significa viajar em uma missão humanitária, por mais digna que seja a causa e sim apenas abrir o coração aos outros . Isso requerer prática e esforço e a bondade pode tornar-se um hábito do coração.

Às vezes, pensamos que as pessoas mais ricas ou os com o menor número de problemas são as mais felizes. Sabemos que isso não é verdade. As pessoas que parecem estar sempre felizes certamente passam por suas dificuldades. Suas vida não são perfeitas, e alguns dias são melhores que outros. A diferença é que elas decidem não focalizar no negativo. Em vez disso, elas se concentram em fazer outras pessoas sorrirem. Para elas, a bondade é uma escolha que se tornou-se um hábito. Elas são felizes porque decidiram fazer outras pessoas felizes.  , O egocentrismo é um lugar triste e solitário de estar. Se buscarmos por mais amor e beleza na vida, espalhemos o mesmo em outras vidas primeiro. Façamos alguém sorrir hoje, e com certeza, também sorriremos.

And yet it is one of life’s great ironies that the moments that make us feel weakest often reveal our hidden strengths. We don’t really know what we can endure until we are forced to endure it. Yale University professor Steven Southwick believes that “most of us are a lot more resilient than we think.” He compares us to a green tree branch—it may not seem as strong as a more mature, rigid limb. But in a strong wind it’s the green branch that survives, bending but never breaking. 

That’s easy to forget when the winds of life seem to be tossing us about. Resilient people know they can’t stop the storm, but they can decide how they react to it. They can take charge of their present and therefore their future. Whatever the challenge may be—a financial crisis, poor health, a conflict in the family or other relationships—they do their best to continue. 

One middle-aged woman learned about her own resilience when her husband died, followed shortly thereafter by serious health problems of her own. The string of difficulties seemed unending, but she just carried on—one hour, one day, one week at a time. It wasn’t easy, but it became easier with the passing of time.

And that’s the other hidden blessing of suffering: those experiences that seem to be weakening us are actually, in many cases, not only revealing our strength but also increasing it. They require resilience, but at the same time they teach us resilience. They prompt us to develop a more optimistic view by cultivating friendships with positive people. They move us to challenge our negative thoughts and strive for a larger perspective. They can even inspire us to reach out to others in love and kindness, which always helps us feel better. Ultimately, patiently bearing up under trials will develop in us the strength and resilience to bend but not break, to remain positive, even to enjoy inner peace as the storms of life swirl around us.

Nunca sabemos cuánto podemos resistir hasta que debemos resistirlo. Un profesor de la Universidad Yale considera que “la mayoría de nosotros es mucho más fuerte de lo que supone”. Nos compara a una rama verde que tal vez no parezca tan resistente como una más madura, pero cuando azota el vendaval es la rama verde la que sobrevive, doblándose mas no llegando a quebrarse.

Eso es fácil de olvidar cuando los vientos de la vida parecen zarandearnos. Las personas tenaces saben que no pueden detener la tormenta, pero que sí pueden hacerle frente y tomar control del presente y, por ende, del futuro. Cualquiera sea el reto —una crisis económica, problemas de salud, conflictos de relación— hacen lo que pueden por seguir adelante.

Una mujer adulta comprendió cuánta tenacidad tenía cuando su esposo falleció y tuvo que enfrentar poco después problemas de salud ella misma. La secuela de problemas parecía interminable, pero ella siguió adelante una hora, un día, una semana a la vez. No fue fácil, pero se fue haciendo menos difícil con el paso del tiempo.

Y esa es la otra bendición oculta del sufrimiento: esas experiencias que parecen debilitarnos, en muchos casos no sólo revelan nuestras fuerzas, sino que las incrementan. Esto requiere tenacidad pero, al mismo tiempo, nos enseña a ser tenaces. Nos instan a ver las cosas con más optimismo al relacionarnos con personas más positivas. Nos hacen enfrentar nuestras ideas negativas, crean una perspectiva más amplia y hasta pueden inspirarnos a ayudar a los demás con amor y bondad, lo cual siempre nos hace sentir mejor. En resumen, si con paciencia soportamos las pruebas, desarrollaremos la fuerza y la tenacidad necesarias para doblarnos sin quebrarnos, para permanecer positivos y para disfrutar paz en medio de las tempestades de la vida.

Mesmo assim, ironicamente, os momentos que nos fazem sentir mais fracos quase sempre revelam as forças que parecíamos não ter. Não sabemos dos nossos limites até sermos forçados a enfrentá-los. O professor Universitário Steven Southwick acredita que, “todos somos muito mais fortes do que pensamos.” Ele nos compara a um galho de árvore que talvez não pareça ser tão forte quanto um tronco. Mas numa tempesdade é o galho que resiste, dobrando porém nunca quebrando.

É fácil esquecermos disso quando os ventos da vida estão sobre nós. As pessoas que são fortes sabem que não podem parar a tempestade, mas podem decidir como reagir a ela. Elas podem controlar o presente e por sua vez o futuro. Seja qual for o desafio, crise financeira, doença, conflitos familiares ou em outros relacionamentos – elas fazem o melhor para seguir em frente.

Uma senhora de meia idade descobriu quão forte ela era após o falecimento de seu esposo, seguido de seus proprios problemas de saúde. Todos aqueles desafios pareciam não ter fim, ela porém permaneceu firme, uma hora, um dia, uma semana de cada vez. Não foi fácil, mas com o pasar do tempo as coisas melhoraram.  

Essas parecem ser as bençãos não vistas do sofrimento: as experiências que aparentemente nos enfraquecem, na realidade revelam não apenas nossa força como também nosso crescimento. Elas requerem sacrificio, mas ao mesmo tempo adquirimos experiência. Ao cultivarmos o otimismo, desenvolvemos a amizade com pessoas positivas. Elas nos ajudam a desafiar nossos pensamentos negativos e a alargar nossa visão. Elas podem até nos inspirar a servir outros em espírito de amor e bondade, o que sempre nos faz sentir bem. Por último, ao pacientemente suportarmos nossos desafios, iremos desenvolver a força de dobrar e não quebrar, de mantermo-nos positivos e desfrutar com alegria a paz, mesmo em meio a tempestade.

He was surprised by what he saw in these volunteers’ faces. “They just radiated a generosity of spirit,” he said. “They radiated a patience and most of all they radiated gratitude for life.” He thought to himself: “I’ve achieved career success in life, but I haven’t achieved that. What they have is that inner light that I do not have.” 

Brooks wanted that kind of light in his life, and he concluded that focusing on his career was not necessarily the way to get it. He “rediscovered the elemental truth” that we all come to understand sooner or later: “[A successful career] doesn’t make you happy.”

So what does? What is it that made those humble English tutors—and others like them from all walks of life—so bright and radiant and happy? Perhaps part of the answer lies in an understanding of what life is all about. Is it just to promote ourselves, achieve as much wealth and status as we can, and make our lives as comfortable as possible until the end comes? Or is there more to life than that?

Brooks thinks so. He distinguishes between two kinds of virtues: “résumé virtues,” the kind we list to impress others and advance our careers; and “eulogy virtues,” the kind people remember at our funeral—those virtues that exist at the core of our being: love, loyalty, kindness, courage.

Even if we’ve already discovered the importance of these deeper virtues, they’re worth rediscovering again and again. When everything else has passed away, the relationships we have formed, the love we’ve felt, the sacrifices we’ve made in behalf of others, even the challenges and internal struggles that have helped us become our best selves—these are the deeper values and virtues that shape our character and give our lives meaning.

Episode 4473. Aired June 7, 2015*NewVideo*Las virtudes más profundas - Palabras de Inspiración**36ciJLz1rZk**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/36ciJLz1rZk/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Un destacado columnista del New York Times visitó en una ocasión un grupo de 30 tutores, principalmente mujeres ancianas, que enseñaban inglés a inmigrantes. Se sorprendió con lo que vio en el rostro de esos voluntarios: “Irradiaban generosidad, paciencia y, sobre todo, irradiaban gratitud por la vida”, comentó. Entonces se dijo a sí mismo: “He logrado el éxito en mi carrera, pero no he llegado a alcanzar esa luz interior que cada una de esas personas tiene”.

El columnista anhelaba ese tipo de luz  pero llegó a la conclusión de que el centrarse en su carrera no lo ayudaría a conseguirla. El hombre redescubrió la sencilla verdad que tarde o temprano todos aprendemos, que el éxito profesional no es lo que nos hace felices.

¿Cómo se logra, entonces? ¿Qué es lo que hacía que aquellos tutores y otras personas como ellos, se sintieran tan radiantes y felices? Tal vez parte de la respuesta está en entender el real significado de la vida. ¿Es acaso el enaltecernos, el acumular la mayor cantidad posible de bienes materiales y rodearnos de comodidades hasta llegar al final de nuestra existencia?, ¿o hay acaso algo más que todo eso?

De tal modo piensa el columnista, distinguiendo entre dos tipos de virtudes: aquellas que se incluyen en el curriculum vitae para impresionar y obtener buenos empleos, o las que se mencionan en un funeral —las virtudes que forman parte de nuestro ser, como la lealtad, la caridad, la integridad, el valor.

Aun cuando ya hayamos descubierto la importancia de esas virtudes más profundas, bien vale la pena redescubrirlas una y otra vez. Cuando todo lo demás haya terminado, las relaciones forjadas, los sacrificios hechos por los demás y hasta los desafíos que nos hayan ayudado a ser lo mejor que podamos, serán las virtudes más profundas que moldearán nuestro carácter y darán significado a nuestra vida.

Episodio 4473. Transmitido el 7 de junio de 2015.*NewVideo*As Mais Profundas Virtudes - Palavras de Inspiração**bLxGNYTURRM**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bLxGNYTURRM/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**O conhecido colunista do New York Times David Brooks certa vez visitou um grupo de 30 tutores, muitos deles mulheres idosas que ensinavam inglês aos imigrantes. Ele ficou surpreso com o que observou. "Eles transmitiam uma generosidade de espírito," disse ele. "Eles irradiavam paciência, e acima de tudo gratidão pela vida. Ele concluiu, "alcancei sucesso na vida, mas nunca nesse nível. O que eles pussuem, e o que eu não tenho,  é um tipo de luz interna."

Brooks buscava esse tipo de luz, e concluiu que focalizar em sua carreira não era necessariamente a maneira de obtê-la. Ele "redescobriu uma simples verdade" que todos nós entenderemos mais cedo ou mais tarde: "uma carreira de sucesso não trás felicidade."

Então qual é a fonte dessa felicidade? O que fizeram esses humildes professores de inglês — e outros como eles — tão brilhantes, radiantes e felizes? Talvez parte da resposta encontra-se em entender o propósito da vida. Será que esse propósito é se auto-promover, adquirir o máximo possível a riqueza e o status e tornar a nossa vida o mais confortável possível? Ou há mais do que isso na vida?

Brooks acreditava que sim. Ele distingue entre dois tipos de virtudes: "virtudes aparentes," o tipo de lista para impressionar os outros e avançar nossas carreiras; e "virtudes permanentes," aquelas que serão lembradas no nosso funeral — virtudes que existem no núcleo do nosso ser: amor, lealdade, bondade e coragem.

Mesmo já sabendo da importância dessas profundas virtudes, vale a pena redescobrí-las. Quando tudo passar,  as relações que formamos, o amor que sentimos, os sacrifícios que fizemos em prol de outros, mesmo os desafios e lutas internas que nos ajudaram a tornar-nos melhores — estes são os valores e virtudes mais profundos que moldam nosso caráter e dá a nossas vidas propósito e significado.

The Choir and Orchestra were asked to help out with a little experiment—they were given the following guidelines for their free time:

Atlantic Coast Tour 2015*NewVideo*Alumbremos el mundo - Palabras de Inspiración**P4OR56C6pGU**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P4OR56C6pGU/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**La luz de la luna, con sus tonos plateados y suaves, ha captado nuestra imaginación por siglos. Ha sido el tema de innumerables poemas, canciones, serenatas y paseos nocturnos. Nos maravillamos ante el resplandor de una luna llena, aun cuando sabemos que es apenas el reflejo de la luz que recibe del sol. De hecho, nuestra luna llena, en su máximo resplandor, sólo refleja un 12 por ciento de la luz que llega a ella.

Por todas partes hay objetos que reflejan o absorben luz. La nieve refleja casi toda la que recibe, pero el asfalto la absorbe, lo cual explica por qué las calles se sobrecalientan en días de intenso sol.

Y ¿qué de nosotros? ¿Cuánta luz reflejamos? ¿Alumbramos el mundo para los demás y compartimos esperanza y buen ánimo? ¿O acaso sólo absorbemos energía, sin hacer el más mínimo esfuerzo por devolver parte de ella?

Hay innumerables maneras de compartir luz con otras personas. Cuando prestamos servicio, cuando escuchamos con atención, cuando elogiamos con sinceridad, cuando enseñamos, reflejamos luz. La Madre Teresa dijo: “Cada vez que le sonreímos a alguien, es un acto de amor, una dádiva, algo hermoso”. Por cierto que algo tan sencillo como una sonrisa devuelve luz y amor al mundo.

Todos nos sentimos atraídos hacia quienes reflejan dicha y optimismo. Tales personas parecen estar impregnadas de luz y fulgor, y no sólo queremos estar en su compañía sino que buscamos la forma de seguir su ejemplo; de emitir ese mismo brillo.

Contrario a lo que sucede con la luna, la nieve o el asfalto, nosotros podemos decidir cuánta luz daremos, y si vamos a reflejar lo bueno que nos rodea en favor de otras personas. A menudo, cuando nuestro objetivo es reflejar tanta luz como podamos, inspiramos a otros a hacer lo mismo. Si todos tomáramos esta sencilla decisión, ese resplandor colectivo alcanzaría para alumbrar el mundo entero.

Tem sido também a inspiração de poemas incontáveis, melodías e serenatas. Nos maravilhamos com brilho de uma lua cheia, mesmo sabendo que ela apenas reflete a luz recebida do Sol. De fato a lua cheia, na sua magnitude, reflete apenas 12 porcento da luz que a ela chega.

Ao nosso redor, objetos refletem ou absorvem luz. A neve, por exemplo, reflete a maioria da luz que chega até ela, por outro lado o asfalto a retém, explicando sua alta temperatura em días ensolarados.

E que tal nós? Quanta luz refletimos? Iluminamos o mundo para outros, trazemos esperança para um dia melhor? Ou será que sugamos energia sem nunca compartilharmos aquilo que recebemos?

Existem infinitas maneiras de trazer luz aos outros. Ao oferecermos ajuda, refletimos luz usando nosso tempo para escutar os outros, ao damos um sincero elogio e esinando uma criança. A Mãe Teresa de Caucutá disse: “Toda vez que sorrimos, estamos fazendo um ato de amor, uma dádiva aquela pessoa, algo lindo.” Sim, até mesmo algo tão simples como um sorriso reflete luz e amor ao mundo.

Somos atraidos as pessoas que refletem alegria e otimismo. Elas parecem ter um brilho, uma luz ao seu redor. Nos encontramos não apenas querendo compartilhar de sua compania, mas também buscamos imitar seu exemplo, e também brilhar.

Diferente da lua, neve ou o asfalto, podemos escolher a quantidade de luz que desejamos dar. Podemos decidir refletir o que há de bom ao nosso redor, ajudando outros a “ver o positivo.”  Muitas vezes, queremos que outros também reflitam essa luz. Se todos fizessemos essa simples escolha, talves nossas luzes poderiam brilhar e iluminar todo o mundo

Episódio 4482. Transmitido em 9 de agosto de 2015.*NewVideo*Brighten the World - The Spoken Word**nNygyCxaFvc**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nNygyCxaFvc/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Moonlight, with its soft, silver tones and the enchanting mood it casts, has captured our fancy for centuries. It has been the subject of countless poems, songs, serenades, and evening walks. We marvel at how bright a full moon can seem sometimes, even though we know it is merely reflecting the light it receives from the sun. In fact, our full moon, at its very brightest, only reflects about 12 percent of the light that reaches it.

All around us, objects reflect or absorb light. Snow reflects almost all the light that reaches it, while black asphalt absorbs it, which explains why roads get so hot on sunny days.

And what about us? How much light do we reflect? Do we brighten the world for others and share the hope and cheer of a sunny outlook? Or do we only take, pulling in energy but never giving any back?

There are countless ways to share light with others. When we extend a helping hand, when we take time to listen, when we give a sincere compliment, when we teach a child, we are reflecting light. Mother Theresa said, “Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing.” Yes, even something as simple as a smile bounces light and love back into the world.

We are drawn to people who reflect joy and optimism. They seem to have a luster, a light, a glow about them. We find ourselves not only wanting to share their company but also striving to emulate their example, to shine with similar brilliance.

Unlike the moon, snow, or asphalt, we can choose how much light we give. We can decide to reflect the good around us and help others see “the bright side.” Very often, when our goal is to provide as much light as we can, we inspire others to do the same. If everyone made this simple choice, perhaps our collective radiance would be enough to light up the entire world.

Lamentablemente, es también una característica humana el caer en la  tentación. ¿Cuántas veces, por ejemplo, nos hemos fijado metas de comer menos y hacer más ejercicio, sólo para volver en poco tiempo a viejos malos hábitos?

A veces suponemos que el secreto está en tener fuerza de voluntad: la capacidad de mirar el plato con galletas de chocolate y resistir la tentación de comernos una. Pero un reciente estudio indica que las personas que resisten la tentación son aquellas que de hecho tratan de mantenerse lo más alejadas posible del plato de galletas, ya que son plenamente conscientes de su debilidad y de la posibilidad de caer.

Por ejemplo, una mujer se veía tentada a leer unos textos que le llegaban mientras manejaba. Comprendiendo el peligro de tan siquiera mirar de reojo esos mensajes, ella siempre pone el teléfono en silencio y fuera de su alcance mientras conduce, eliminando así la tentación de leer textos en medio del tráfico.

Del mismo modo, si nos estamos cuidando en lo que comemos, no pasaremos por la sección de golosinas en el mercado. Si queremos mantenernos alejados de los riesgos de la tecnología, bloquearemos ciertos accesos a nuestros aparatos. Si procuramos ahorrar dinero, veremos de cortar los gastos en cosas que en realidad no necesitamos.

De por sí la vida es difícil aun sin ponernos al alcance de las tentaciones. Todos sabemos cuáles son nuestros puntos débiles y cuáles situaciones ponen nuestros objetivos en peligro. En este caso, el evitar la tentación no es una señal de debilidad sino de valor, una muestra de la verdadera fuerza de voluntad, que puede ser la clave de toda victoria personal.

Infelizmente, essa mesma natureza nos leva a perder o foco e dar lugar a tentação. Quantas vezes, por exemplo, fizemos metas para exercitar, melhorar nossa dieta, e pouco depois estamos comendo as mesmas coisas não saudáveis.
As vezes pensamos que o segredo para melhorar está na força de vontade: a habilidade de olhar para um prato de bolachas e resistir a tentação de comer uma bolachinha sequer. Um recente estudo sugere que aqueles que resistem a esse tipo de tentação na realidade, ficam o mais longe possível do prato de bolachas. Cientes de suas fraquezas, eles “conscientemente evitam a possibilidade do fracasso.”

Por exemplo, uma mulher se encontrou tentada a ler as mensagens de texto que chegavam, enquanto dirigia. Sabendo do perigo, não só para ela mas para os outros, de apenas olhar o telefone, ela colocava e celular no silenciador sempre que dirigia. Dessa maneira ela eliminou qualquer tentação de ler ou enviar texto enquanto manejava.

Da mesma forma, se estamos tentando comer saudavelmente, devemos evitar o local dos doces nos supermercado. Se queremos ficar longe das armadilhas negativas da tecnología, podemos colocar filtros e bloqueios em nossos aparelhos ou usá-los de forma positiva. Se queremos economizar, podemos diminuir o tempo olhando as vitrines ou navegar online.

A vida já é dura o suficiente para colocarnos ao alcançe das tentações. Sabemos quais são os nossos pontos fracos e das cituações e circunstancias que podem colocar em risco nossas metas. Evitar, nesse sentido, não é uma fraqueza, é uma virtude, um sinal de força de vontade, e na luta para obter o auto controle, talvez seja a chave para a vitória.

Aired June 14, 2015*NewVideo*Resisting Temptation - The Spoken Word**paDSy2ZzVOI**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/paDSy2ZzVOI/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**It’s human nature to want to improve, to progress—to overcome our weaknesses and build upon our strengths. Unfortunately, it’s also part of human nature to get distracted and give in to temptation. How many times, for example, have we set goals to exercise or improve our diet, only to find ourselves eating junk food again before long? 

Sometimes we think the secret to self-improvement is willpower: the ability to stare at a plate of chocolate chip cookies and resist the temptation to eat one. But a recent study suggests that people who excel at resisting temptation actually take it one step further—they stay as far away from the plate of cookies as possible. Aware of their own weaknesses, they “deliberately avoid situations in which their self-control might fail.” 

For example, one woman found herself tempted to read incoming text messages while driving. Realizing the dangers that even glancing at her phone would pose to herself and others, she routinely silences her phone and places it out of reach while driving—successfully eliminating the temptation to text and drive.

In the same way, if we’re trying to eat healthier, we may want to avoid the snack aisle in the grocery store. If we’re trying to avoid technology’s time-sapping and destructive pitfalls, we may want to place blocks on our devices or find positive uses for technology. If we’re trying to save money, we may want to cut down on window shopping or online browsing.

Life is hard enough without putting ourselves within temptation’s reach. We know what our own weak spots are, and we know what situations and circumstances put our goals at risk. Avoidance, in this sense, is not weakness—it’s strength; it’s a mark of true willpower. And in our battle for self-control, it may be the key to victory.

Episode 4424. June 29, 2014*NewVideo*¿Qué podemos hacer para mejorar? - Palabras de Inspiración**_IkvgHINi5Q**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_IkvgHINi5Q/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**En un salón de clase de escuela primaria colmado de niños llenos de energía, la maestra pide que respondan dos preguntas. La primera, “¿Qué es lo que más les gusta de nuestro país?”. La respuesta llegó sin demora: las bellezas naturales, los paisajes, todo cuanto hay para ver y para hacer, la libertad, la gente, y muchas cosas más. Entonces la maestra hizo la segunda pregunta, más importante que la anterior: “¿Qué podemos hacer para que nuestro país sea mejor?”.

Una cosa es apreciar la historia y la singularidad de una tierra, y maravillarnos de su belleza, pero otra muy distinta es tomar parte activa en la preservación de sus virtudes, en perpetuar sus ideales y defender sus valores. A la patria se le ama mejor de un modo personal que a la distancia. Por cierto que todo país, más allá de lo mucho que lo valoremos, tiene sus problemas, pero ninguna nación tiene que ser perfecta para ser amada. De hecho, el amor por la patria es lo que nos inspira a encontrar formas de superar sus defectos, de garantizar la libertad y de conceder a su gente las oportunidades que todo ser humano necesita para mejorar y progresar.

Hacemos de la nuestra una nación mejor al informarnos y participar en causas buenas, al trabajar juntos a pesar de las diferencias, y al ayudarnos y elevarnos mutuamente.
Como nación, nos conservamos fuertes y libres al trabajar constructivamente en favor de nuestras comunidades, y seremos un ejemplo para quienes nos observan al respaldarnos en los valores que forjaron nuestra identidad.

Los verdaderos patriotas son quienes atesoran la libertad y hacen su parte para mejorar la tierra que aman. A cada uno nos cabe responder la pregunta hecha a aquellos niños: “¿Qué podemos hacer para que nuestro país sea mejor?”.

Episodio 4424. Transmitido el 29 de junio de 2014.*NewVideo*What Can You Do? - The Spoken Word**VZ_Qff5dbzA**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VZ_Qff5dbzA/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**In an elementary school classroom filled with energetic children, the teacher asks the students to respond to two questions. The first question is “What do you like most about living in America?” The answers come quickly: the beautiful land and scenery, the lakes and mountains, the many things to do and see, the freedom, the people, and on and on. After the children finish their responses, the teacher asks a second and more important question: “So what can you do to make America better?” 

It’s one thing to appreciate America’s history and uniqueness and marvel at its beauty and prosperity; it’s another thing to take an active part in preserving its strengths, perpetuating its ideals, and defending the values it holds dear. America is best loved up close and personal, not at a detached distance. And, of course, while extraordinary, America is not without vexing problems and concerns. But a country doesn’t have to be perfect to be beloved. In fact, our love for our country is what inspires us to find ways to overcome its flaws and shortcomings. And one thing we love so much about America is the freedom and opportunity it grants us to tirelessly pursue improvement and progression.

We make our nation better by getting informed and involved in good causes, by working together despite our differences, by helping each other and lifting those around us.  

As a nation, we will remain strong and free if we constructively work to improve our communities. We will continue to stand as a light of liberty for the world if we uphold the values and principles upon which this nation was founded. 

True patriots are those who cherish freedom and do their part to improve and strengthen the land they love. We would do well to answer the question posed to the schoolchildren: “What can you do to make it better?”

Sin embargo, a veces parece más fácil hallar a alguien dispuesto a llorar con uno en momentos de angustia que encontrar a quien se regocije con nuestros éxitos. La mayoría de las personas demuestran ser compasivas con los que sufren, pero es en quienes genuinamente se deleitan en el éxito ajeno que se manifiesta una cualidad singular.

A tal cualidad se le suele llamar una “mentalidad de abundancia”, o sea, la convicción de que la vida está colmada de buena fortuna, que todos podemos ser felices y que la dicha de una persona no disminuye su caudal para los demás. Quienes así piensan no se sienten celosos de aquel que está saliendo adelante en la carrera de la vida, puesto que saben que la vida no es una carrera. Miden el éxito no por la cantidad de gente que dejan atrás sino por cuántos impulsan hacia adelante. Sienten que el triunfo individual es una victoria colectiva, y tal generosidad de espíritu les llena de paz y alegría.

La vida, de por sí, puede resultar inquietante y el transformarla en una competencia complicará las cosas aún más. ¿Cómo podemos superar la propensión a contar victorias y derrotas? ¿Cómo podemos llegar a festejar la dicha y el éxito de los demás?

Tal vez la respuesta esté en ver más allá de lo mundano de la vida y desarrollar una visión más amplia de esta existencia mortal. Esto quizá nos ayude a ver que no somos víctimas, que nuestros buenos esfuerzos generalmente dan dividendos positivos, y que las cosas de mayor importancia, como el amor, la paz y la verdadera dicha, son realmente perpetuas. Veremos que el guardarnos una felicitación no nos hará más felices. En realidad, es cuando mostramos tener un corazón pleno y vitoreamos a los demás, que nos sentimos mejor. Quizá nuestras circunstancias no cambien, pero el corazón sí. Somos bendecidos con mayor serenidad cuando nos regocijamos con quienes se regocijan. El alegrarnos por el éxito de los demás nutre de alegría todo nuestro ser.

Episodio 4455. Transmitido el 1 de febrero de 2015.*NewVideo*Rejoice with Those Who Rejoice - The Spoken Word**GCXQreh1kSY**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GCXQreh1kSY/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Feeling genuinely happy for another person’s good fortune may be one of the truest marks of authentic goodness and real friendship. Surprisingly, it sometimes seems easier to find someone who will weep with us during our hard times than to find someone who will rejoice with us in our successes. Most people are compassionate and caring toward those who suffer, but a special quality manifests itself in those who are genuinely happy for the good fortune of others.

Some have called this quality an “abundance mentality”—the conviction that life is full of good fortune, that there’s plenty of happiness to go around, and that one person’s joy does not deplete the supply for everyone else. Those with such abundant hearts do not feel threatened or jealous when someone seems to be winning at the race of life, because they know that life is not a race. They measure success in life not by how many people they surpass but by how many people they lift. They feel that every man or woman’s triumph is a victory for us all, and this generosity of spirit gives them peace and contentment. 

Life can be unsettling enough; turning it into a competition only makes us feel less secure. So how can we overcome the human tendency to count wins and losses? How can we enlarge our hearts to make room for joy in the successes of others? 

Perhaps the answer lies in looking beyond life’s mundane, fleeting things and intentionally holding on to a larger perspective—the big picture. This may help us see that we are not victims, that things will eventually work out for us, and that the things that really matter—like peace, love, and real joy—are truly everlasting. We will see that withholding a compliment or congratulations does not make us happier. Simply stated, when we choose to have an abundant heart, when we decide to cheer for others, we just feel better. Our circumstances may not change, but our heart does. We are blessed with more serenity when we rejoice with those who rejoice. Indeed, happiness for others’ successes nurtures happiness within ourselves.

Los hijos que ayer eran pequeños, dependientes de uno y que disfrutaban el tiempo con su familia, de pronto crecen, son independientes y están ansiosos de encontrar su propio lugar en el mundo. Es como si los años transcurrieran cada vez más rápido.

¿A dónde se ha ido el tiempo? Pues, lo hemos vivido. Tal vez si recordamos esto seremos más propensos a sacar el mayor provecho del tiempo que aún nos queda. Podemos valorar los momentos que nos ayudaron a moldear a nuestros hijos y a nosotros mismos; aferrarnos a los recuerdos felices y también recordar los errores —pero sólo para aprender de ellos— y después seguir adelante. A partir de hoy mismo, podemos forjar relaciones más fuertes con nuestros hijos, un momento a la vez.

Un hijo ya crecido recordó los buenos momentos vividos con su padre en su infancia y adolescencia, y ninguno de los que recordaba con más claridad habían sido costosos ni exóticos. En apariencia eran pequeños intercambios entre padre e hijo: conversaciones, experiencias compartidas, paseos o tareas que hacían juntos. Definitivamente, sus recuerdos más significativos eran una serie de momentos sencillos en los que su padre le demostraba amor.

Hay veces que parecería ser más fácil para un padre someterse a la rutina de su empleo que a la de su vida de hogar. Pero su amorosa y atenta presencia en su familia marca una diferencia notable. Es más que una figura decorativa; trata de aprovechar cada oportunidad, cada valioso momento para fomentar una buena relación con sus hijos, y también con sus nietos. A menudo no es fácil y requiere gran paciencia y sabiduría, pero no habrá nunca una empresa más significativa que la que llevamos a cabo dentro de las paredes de nuestro hogar.

El tener éxito como padre no es cuestión de hacer algunas cosas extraordinarias sino de ser constante en muchas cosas sencillas. El éxito como padre es aprovechar toda ocasión que se presente para forjar momentos inolvidables.

Episodio 4422. Transmitido el 15 de junio de 2014.*NewVideo*Fatherhood Moments - The Spoken Word**GySAi14T18Q**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GySAi14T18Q/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**At times, every father wonders, “Where did the time go?” Children who just yesterday were so small, so dependent on us, so eager to spend time with us, suddenly become so grown up, so independent, and so anxious to find their own place in the world. The years speed on, and they seem to go faster each day. 

So where did the time go? Simply put, we lived it. Perhaps by remembering this we will be more inclined to make the most of the time we still have and live it well. We can cherish the meaningful moments, large and small, that helped to shape our children—and us. We can hold on to the happy memories and even remember the mistakes—but only long enough to learn from them—and then move on. Starting today, we can build strong relationships with our children, moment by moment. 

A grown son reflected on the good times he had with his father while growing up. Interestingly, the moments he remembered most clearly were neither expensive nor exotic. They were seemingly small exchanges between father and son: conversations, shared experiences, campouts, projects they completed together. By far his most meaningful memories were a series of simple moments when his father demonstrated love.

In many ways, it seems easier for fathers to move up the professional ladder than to be engaged in the life of the home. And yet the loving presence of an attentive father makes such a big difference. He is more than just a guest in his home; he strives to take advantage of every opportunity, every precious moment, to build bridges to his children—and grandchildren. It’s often not easy, and takes great patience and wisdom, but there can be no greater or more meaningful work than the work we do within the walls of our home.

Being a successful father is not so much about doing a few extraordinary things as it is about diligently doing many simple things. It’s making the most of fatherhood moments, day by day, year after year, before they slip away.

Sometimes our homes and closets and lives are filled with so much clutter, so much stuff, that we feel overwhelmed, even burdened by it all. There’s so much to take care of, to worry about, to dust and clean, that the clutter seems to smother the joy out of life. Eliminating some of that clutter from our lives can be such a satisfying feeling. And it can serve as a good reminder that we treasure relationships and experiences more than things—that time together is more meaningful than stuff we buy that ends up in boxes and attics.

One recent best-selling author suggests an easy way to decide what to keep and what to discard: for each item, simply ask, “Does this spark joy?” Her advice is to “keep only the things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and discard all the rest. When you put your house in order, you put your affairs and your past in order, too. As a result, you can see quite clearly what you need in life and what you don’t.”

The fact is most of us would do well to unclutter more than just our closets. Letting go of material possessions can be a step toward tidying up the rest of our lives, helping us to clean out the debris in our soul and refocus our energies on people and things of greater worth. 

So perhaps it’s time to determine whether there’s clutter in our hearts that should be discarded—to throw out resentment and anger and replace them with affection and acceptance; throw out apathy and idleness and replace them with purposefulness and worthy activity; throw out envy and smallness and replace them with largeness of heart and generosity of spirit; throw out anything that constricts the soul and leave room only for those things that spark true joy.

Their delighted squeals express gratitude when their mothers push them on the swings. Their eyes sparkle with appreciation when their mothers feed them. They whisper thanks as they snuggle close when their mothers read them bedtime stories. Though sometimes unspoken, their gratitude feels natural and spontaneous—almost involuntary. It is simply part of their countenance and disposition.

Mothers cherish those expressions of gratitude. They treasure the pictures they draw, the crafts they make, the notes they write, and the words they speak. They keep them close to their hearts and memorize their sentiments. Mothers love to know that they are loved and appreciated.

But sometimes things change as children grow older. Sometimes children get so busy, so preoccupied, and so stressed that they may forget to thank their mothers, who do so much for them. Some children may even come to expect the help they are given. Worse yet, they may feel entitled and stop feeling grateful. 

The Lord warned against such ingratitude in the fifth of His Ten Commandments: “Honour thy father and thy mother” (Exodus 20:12). Honoring, like gratitude, is much more than words—it’s a way of living. And when it is sincere, it shows in our every action.

Cards, flowers, and gifts on holidays are wonderful, but the best kinds of thanks are the unexpected: the heartfelt expressions of love that come for no apparent reason—the whole year long. When a grown daughter calls her mother just to talk, when a grown son stops by to bring his mother a favorite treat, when children and grandchildren make efforts to involve Grandmother in their lives—these are the expressions of thanks that bind one generation to the next. These are the days that mothers never forget; the days that help mothers know they are loved, appreciated, and remembered now and forever.

Sus felices chillidos expresan gratitud cuando mamá los empuja en el columpio. Sus ojos brillan con agradecimiento cuando ella les da de comer. Dan gracias en susurros cada noche cuando mamá se acurruca con ellos para leerles un cuento antes de dormir. Aunque a veces en silencio, su gratitud se siente natural y espontánea —casi involuntaria. Es sencillamente parte de todo cuanto se dibuja en su rostro y se manifiesta en su disposición.

Las madres atesoran esas expresiones de agradecimiento; los dibujos y las manualidades que ellos les hacen, las notas que escriben y todo cuanto les dicen. Conservan todo eso muy cerca del corazón y nunca olvidan lo que sienten. A las madres les encanta saber que se les ama y se les valora.

Pero a veces las cosas cambian cuando los hijos crecen y están tan ocupados, tan angustiados y tan estresados que tal vez olviden agradecer a su madre por todas las cosas que hace por ellos. Algunos hijos quizá lleguen a esperar esa ayuda que reciben. Peor aún, es posible que sientan tener derecho a todo eso y dejen de sentir agradecimiento.

El Señor advirtió en cuanto a ello en el quinto de Sus Diez Mandamientos: “Honra a tu padre y a tu madre” (Éxodo 20:12). Honrar, al igual que agradecer, es mucho más que una expresión verbal —es una forma de vivir, y cuando es sincera, se manifiesta en cada hecho.

Las tarjetas, las flores y otros obsequios en días especiales es todo magnífico, pero las mejores muestras de gratitud son las inesperadas: las expresiones de amor espontáneas —todo a lo largo del año. Cuando una hija  llama a su madre tan sólo para hablar, cuando un hijo pasa por la casa de sus padres a dejarle algo sencillo a su mamá, cuando los hijos y los nietos se esfuerzan por incluir a la abuela en su vida; todas ésas son expresiones de gratitud que unen a las generaciones. Estos son los días que las madres nunca olvidan, los que les hacen saber que se les ama, se les valora y se les recuerda hoy y para siempre.

Episode 4419. Aired May 25, 2014*NewVideo*Honremos a nuestros héroes - Palabras de Inspiración**yGQzMRhp4J0**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yGQzMRhp4J0/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**El 3 de febrero de 1943, el buque Dorchester del Ejército estadounidense, surcó las congeladas aguas del Atlántico Norte rumbo al frente de batalla durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. A bordo había 900 soldados entrenados en diferentes instalaciones militares. El encrespado mar ofrecía enormes peligros con los submarinos alemanes asechando en lo que se conocía como “el callejón de los torpedos”.

Poco después de la medianoche, uno de tales submarinos disparó tres torpedos contra el Dorchester. Uno de ellos dio en el centro del blanco y el buque empezó a hundirse. Varios soldados perdieron la vida, muchos fueron heridos y algunos saltaron por la borda. Cuatro capellanes del ejército —dos ministros protestantes, un sacerdote católico, y un rabino judío— se encontraban entre los primeros en alcanzar la cubierta superior. En cumplimiento de la misión de los capellanes, de inmediato empezaron a brindar consuelo, guía y esperanza. Con tranquilidad pasaron chalecos salvavidas y, cuando estos se acabaron, se quitaron los propios, se los dieron a soldados en pánico y los llevaron hasta los botes salvavidas que les aguardaban.

Mientras la nave se deslizaba hacia la profundidad del océano, desde los botes los soldados vieron a los capellanes de pie en el casco del barco, tomados del brazo, orando. 230 fueron rescatados esa noche, pero casi 700 murieron.

Ninguno de los cuatro capellanes se halló entre los sobrevivientes.

Uno de los soldados que fue testigo del acto de abnegación de esos hombres, dijo: “Fue el hecho más extraordinario jamás visto de este lado del cielo”.
Al honrar a quienes dieron su vida en el servicio de su patria, recordamos que la fe y la entrega son elementos fundamentales en una existencia honorable. Su ejemplo nos enseña a lo que esos elementos llevan y lo que el valor, la compasión y el sacrificio realmente significan. Reconozcamos y valoremos esas cualidades en otras personas y tratemos de forjarlas en nosotros mismos.

Transmitido el 25 de Mayo de 2014.*NewVideo*Honoring Our Heroes - The Spoken Word**PPgvGIX7Ju8**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PPgvGIX7Ju8/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**On February 3, 1943, the U.S. Army troopship Dorchester, part of a naval convoy, steamed steadily across the icy waters of the North Atlantic Ocean en route to World War II’s European front. On board were 900 soldiers trained at military facilities like this one, Camp Williams, in Utah. The seas were rough, and the stretch was treacherous; German submarines were known to lurk below in what was called “torpedo alley.” 

At 12:55 a.m. a German submarine fired three torpedoes at the Dorchester. One ripped into the middle of the ship, and it swiftly began to sink. Chaos erupted on board. Several soldiers were killed; several more were injured. Some men jumped overboard. Four army chaplains—Protestant ministers George Fox and Clark Poling, Catholic priest John Washington, and Jewish rabbi Alexander Goode—were among the first to reach the top deck. Doing what chaplains do, they immediately began providing comfort, guidance, and hope. Calmly and systematically they distributed life jackets and, when the supply ran out, took off their own life jackets, handed them to the panicked soldiers, and pointed them to waiting lifeboats. 

As the ship slid beneath the surface, soldiers in lifeboats caught one last look at the chaplains standing on the hull of the ship, arm-in-arm, praying. Rescue ships pulled 230 to safety that night, but almost 700 died.

The four chaplains were not among the survivors. 

John Ladd, one of the survivors who witnessed the chaplains’ selfless acts, later said, “It was the finest thing I have seen or hope to see this side of heaven.”

As we honor those who gave their lives in service to our country, we remember that faith and selflessness are fundamental to honorable living. Their examples teach us where faith and selflessness lead and what courage, compassion, and sacrifice really mean. May we recognize and value these qualities in others and strive to develop them in ourselves.

Episode 4419. Aired May 25, 2014*NewVideo*Asombro - Palabras de Inspiración**oY5DA7ja3M4**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oY5DA7ja3M4/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Al final de una larga y complicada jornada, se le preguntó a un joven universitario cómo se sentía. En vez de referirse a su difícil clase de química o a sus muchas tareas, él habló de la hermosa puesta de sol que había visto de regreso a su casa. Lo mejor de su día había sido un momento de asombro.

Asombro es lo que sentimos al encontrar algo majestuoso que trasciende nuestra misma existencia, algo que nos libera de lo mundano y expande la forma como vemos la vida. Todos necesitamos esos momentos de maravilla que nos calman, amplían nuestras perspectivas y elevan nuestra actitud.

Según un reciente estudio, tales experiencias nos benefician de múltiples modos, desde gozar una salud más fuerte hasta mejorar nuestras relaciones. Nos hacen más prestos a extender una mano de ayuda y a compartir, y menos interesados en la remuneración material por el bien que hacemos.

Parece haber algo en esos momentos de asombro que pone la vida en perspectiva y nos inspira a confiar en los demás y a conectarnos mejor con ellos. Esas experiencias nos empequeñecen pero al mismo tiempo despiertan el deseo de trasponer los límites de nuestro círculo privado y acoger a toda la humanidad.

Y lo mejor de todo es que este mundo está lleno de “experiencias asombrosas” a nuestro alrededor y todo lo que tenemos que hacer es buscarlas. Tal vez alcance con dar un paseo y observar lo bello de la naturaleza, o detenernos a disfrutar un cielo estrellado o un hermoso amanecer; ver cómo se divierten los nietos en un parque infantil o presenciar la maravilla del nacimiento de un bebé; escuchar música inspiradora, ver o leer algo que nos eleve —todas esas cosas, pueden despertar asombro. Si dedicamos tiempo a buscar esos momentos, a valorar algo magnífico, a contemplar algo más trascendental que uno mismo, quizá nos sorprendamos al ver que nuestra vida es más plena y está más colmada de momentos de asombro de lo que jamás habíamos imaginado.

Ao invés de falar da difícil classe de química, ou da árdua terefa a ser completada, ele mencionou o lindo pôr do sol que havia contemplado a caminho de casa. Aquela maravilha tinha sido o melhor momento.

Estar maravilhado é o que sentimos ao depararmos com o majestoso, algo maior que nós mesmos. Aquilo nos livra do mundano e expande a maneira como encaramos o mundo. Precisamos desses momentos de “maravilha” para acalmar nossos nervos, alargar nossa visão e elevar nossa atitude.

De acordo com os recentes estudos, as maravilhosas experiências “melhoram não apenas a saúde mas até nossos relacionamentos." Tais experiências nos ajudam a agir mais prontamente ao serviço de outros e menos interesados nas recompensas monetarias pelo bem que prestamos.

Parece haver algo inspirador nesses momentos de maravilha que nos da a perspectiva correta e nos inspira a confiar e conectar com outros seres. Tal experiência nos faz sentirmos pequenos e ao mesmo tempo nos faz alcançar além dos limites do nosso círculo pessoal e abraçar a humanidade.

As boas novas é que esse mundo glorioso está cheio de “experiências maravilhosas.” Elas estão em toda a parte, o que precisamos fazer é buscá-las. Pode ser uma caminhada pelo parque e observar as belezas da natureza, ou olhar as profundezas do céu ou um simples amanhecer. Brincar com os netos ou a santidade de um bebê. Escutar músicas inspiradoras, assistir um bom programa de televisão, ler algo enriquecedor. Ficamos maravilhados com tudo isso. Se prestarmos atenção nesses momentos, desfrutaremos algo grandioso e glorioso, contemplaremos algo maior que nós mesmos e ficaremos surpresos que nossa vida é bem maior do que imaginamos e cheia de mais maravilhas que pensávamos.

Instead of mentioning his difficult chemistry class or his burdensome homework assignment, he talked about the beautiful sunset he saw on his way home. The highlight of his day was a moment of awe. 

Awe is what we feel when we encounter something vast and majestic, something bigger than ourselves. It breaks us free from the mundane and expands the way we see the world. We all need these moments of awe that calm our nerves, enlarge our perspective, and lift our attitude. 

According to recent studies, awe-inspiring experiences “benefit us in all sorts of ways, from stronger health to improved relationships.” They make us quicker to help someone in need, more willing to share with others, and less interested in monetary rewards for the good we do. 

There seems to be something about awe-inspiring moments that puts life in perspective and inspires us to trust and connect with our fellow human beings. Such experiences make us feel small while at the same time making us want to reach out beyond the limits of our private circle and embrace all of humanity. 

And the good news is that this glorious world is full of “awe experiences.” They’re all around us—all we have to do is look for them. That may mean taking a walk or a drive to see the beauties of nature. Or pausing to look deeply into a star-filled sky or at a glorious sunrise. Or watching grandkids having fun at a playground, or reveling in the joy of a new baby. Listening to inspiring music, watching an uplifting television program, or reading something enriching—all of these things can create awe. If we take the time to seek moments of awe, to appreciate something grand and glorious, to contemplate something bigger than ourselves, we may be surprised to find that our life is bigger, grander, and filled with more awe than we ever imagined.

Episode 4465. Aired April 12, 2015*NewVideo*A Esperança Desta Época - Palavras de Inspiração**suTdnOjEBBU**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/suTdnOjEBBU/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Foi dito que Deus reescreve o livro de Gênesis a cada primavera. A frase “e no princípio” tem um significado especial ao testemunharmos, a cada ano, a renovação da vida e o renascimento, que fazem parte do ciclo das estações da Terra. É como se a própria natureza declarasse que, independente do que passamos, as coisas podem mudar e melhorar. Não importa quão longo seja o inverno, a primavera sempre retorna. Os dias se tornarão mais longos, o clima mais quente, e a vida será renovada. Tudo isso é um lembrete da esperança, e como disse Robert Browning: “Deus está no céu, o mundo está bem!”

Precisamos dessa constante afirmação, especialmente nos momentos dificeis onde nada parece estar bem com o mundo. Quando o fogo da verdade e fé for extinto, precisamos saber que ele pode ser reaceso em nossa alma. Quando corações forem partidos e sonhos desfeitos, devemos ser lembrados de que eles, com o tempo, podem ser consertados. Assim como a grama esmaecida, os arbustos já secos, e as árvores sem folhas podem se tornar verdes e florescer mais uma vez, nós podemos acreditar na promessa de uma vida nova.

Nesse espírito, um poeta observou:
 
“Me pergunto se uma flor
encolhe-se ao cair da geada,
 
?E suas pétalas perdendo o vigor,
Sonham ter sua vida acabada?

E se assim for, quão doce o momento,
Será na primavera o seu renascimento!”

Essa é a esperança da Páscoa. É a certeza de que nada se perde para sempre, e ninguém se ausenta eternamente. De fato, a tristeza, o desânimo, e até a morte em si, não é o final de tudo, contanto que tenhamos esperança na “ressurreição ocorrida naquela primavera”. É por isso que  cantamos: “Salve o dia em que ressuscitarmos”; da dúvida à devoção, do temor à fé, da morte para a vida!

La frase “En el principio”, adquiere un nuevo significado cada año al ver renacer la vida de la tierra en cada uno de sus ciclos de estaciones. Es como si la naturaleza misma tratara de decirnos que más allá de las circunstancias, las cosas pueden cambiar y mejorar. No importa cuán largo sea el invierno, la primavera por cierto vendrá. Los días se harán más resplandecientes y más cálidos y todo renacerá. Como lo expresó el escritor Robert Browning: “Dios está en Su cielo; todo está bien en el mundo”.

De vez en cuando necesitamos esa reafirmación, especialmente en los momentos en que la vida se hace difícil y todo parece trastornado en el mundo. Cuando la llama de la verdad y la fe se ha extinguido, debemos saber que podemos volver a avivarla en el alma. Cuando el corazón y los sueños se despedazan, tenemos que recordar que con el tiempo pueden ser restaurados. Así como la vegetación ensombrecida del invierno reverdece con la llegada de la primavera, podemos creer en la promesa de una nueva vida y de comienzos renovados.

En ese mismo espíritu, un poeta dijo:
“Me pregunto si el narciso en flor
con la escharcha queda encogido
y cuando sus venas pierden vigor,
sueña que la vida ya se ha ido.
Qué dulce entonces, si así fuera,
su renacer en la primavera.

Esa es la esperanza de esta época del año; la seguridad de que nada se pierde permanentemente y que nadie se marcha para siempre. Por cierto que ni la angustia, el desánimo y ni siquiera la muerte son terminantes mientras tengamos la esperanza de ese “renacer en la primavera”. El antiguo himno, “Salve, día de resurrección”, nos invita a pasar de la duda a la devoción, del temor a la fe, de la muerte a la vida.

It’s as if nature itself is trying to tell us that whatever we are going through, things can change—things can get better. No matter how long the winter, spring is sure to follow. The days will become a little brighter, the weather a little warmer, and life will be restored. Ultimately, it’s a reminder of the hope expressed by Robert Browning: “God’s in his heaven—all’s right with the world!”

We need that reassurance from time to time, especially in moments when life gets hard and all doesn’t seem right with the world. When the fire of truth and faith has been extinguished, we need to know that it can be rekindled and burn again in our souls. When hearts have been broken and dreams shattered, we need to be reminded that they can be mended and rebuilt over time. Just as surely as brown grass, battered shrubs, and leafless trees can become green and blooming once again, we can believe in the promise of new life and renewed beginnings. 

In that spirit, a poet once observed:
 
“I wonder if the Daffodil
Shrinks from the touch of frost,

And when her veins grow stiff and still
She dreams that life is lost?

Ah, if she does, how sweet a thing
Her resurrection day in spring!”

That is the hope of this season. It is the assurance that nothing is ever permanently lost, that no one is forever gone. Indeed, heartbreak, discouragement—even death itself is not final, as long as we have hope in that “resurrection day in spring.” This is why we sing, “Hail the day that sees [us] rise”—from doubt to devotion, from fear to faith, from death to life!

Ningún suflé es fácil de hacer y debe ser servido rápidamente para que no se hunda. La mujer guardó la receta por años, pero nunca se sintió confiada de poder prepararla. Su familia creció y ella envejeció, y finalmente pasó la receta a una de sus hijas con este sabio consejo: “Corre el riesgo; haz el suflé. Si se hunde, se hunde; pero nunca lo conseguirás si no lo intentas”.

Muchos deseamos vivir ciertas experiencias, desarrollar ciertos talentos o ganar nuevos conocimientos, pero no pasamos de ahí. Entonces, en lo que parece ser un abrir y cerrar de ojos, la ventana de la oportunidad se cierra.

Tal vez vacilemos por temer al fracaso, sin embargo, el mayor riesgo está en no arriesgar y el mayor fracaso en no intentarlo, y así nunca saborearemos ese suflé, no tendremos nuevas experiencias ni adquiriremos nuevos conocimientos.

Entonces, ¿cómo nos libramos de las limitaciones que nos imponemos? Podemos empezar por intentar hacer algo nuevo. Podemos saludar al compañero de trabajo con el que nunca hablamos; probar un nuevo plato o leer un libro de un nuevo autor. Podemos probar una actividad física que nos haya parecido imposible o inscribirnos en una clase que siempre hayamos querido tomar. Podemos navegar el Internet para leer de nuevos descubrimientos o empezar a aprender un nuevo idioma.

No esperemos hasta “algún día”, ya que el mejor momento es hoy. Una madre muy sabia dijo una vez a un hijo: “Dentro de veinte años lamentarás más lo que no hayas hecho que lo que sí hayas hecho. Así que suelta las amarras, lánzate a la mar, deja que los vientos inflen tus velas y explora, sueña y descubre”.

Así como con el suflé, si nos hundimos, nos hundimos, pero si no lo intentamos, nunca lograremos nada.

Porém ao ler a receita, ela ficou receosa de que a massa não ficaria leve e macia. Fazer um suflê não é fácil e deve ser servido rapidamente ou ele desanda. E assim passaram-se os anos, as festas e as comemorações e ela continuou guardando a receita, sem coragem de fazê-la. As crianças cresceram e o tempo passou. Finalmente ela deu a receita a uma de suas filhas com um sábio conselho: “Tente. Faça o suflê. Se desandar, desandou. Mas você nunca saberá, a não ser tentando.”

Sonhamos em viajar, em talentos a serem desenvolvidos, em fazer novas amizades, mas esses planos ficam para trás, esquecidos no dia a dia. E então, como num piscar de olhos, o tempo passa fechando a janela da oportunidade.

Talvez exitamos porque tememos o fracasso, porém o risco maior é não arriscar; o maior fracasso é o de não tentar. Assim, o sabor do suflê, a incrível paisagem, o telento não desenvolvido são apenas sonhos nunca realizados.

Então, como nos liberar das auto-impostas limitações? Podemos começar ao tentar algo novo. Podemos falar com aquela pessoa tímida no trabalho. Que tal tentar novas comidas ou ler um livro de um autor desconhecido. Escrever-se num cursinho de pintura ou algo parecido. Aprender algo novo. Podemos pesquisar na internet e conhecer sobre a vida de pessoas interessantes, lugares fascinantes, novas descobertas científicas porque não aprender um novo idioma.

Não espere pelo “de rrepente”. A realidade é o agora, o hoje. Certa mãe disse: “Em vinte anos, você estará mais desapontado pelas coisas que não fez, do que aquelas que fez. Então, solte o barco e velege, longe da segurança do ancoradouro. Pegue o vento. Explore. Sonhe. Descubra.”

Assim como o suflê, se desandarmos, desandamos. Mas nunca saberemos se não tentarmos.

But she became nervous when she read the recipe for the light, fluffy cake. Soufflé is not easy to make, and it has to be served quickly to keep it from falling. So as the years, holidays, and birthdays went by, she continued to save the recipe, not quite ready to attempt it. Her family grew up, and she grew old. Finally she gave the recipe to one of her children with this wise counsel: “Take the risk. Make the soufflé. If it falls, it falls. But you’ll never have it if you don’t try.”

Many of us have trips we wish to take, talents we want to develop, even friends we’d like to make, but our plans get caught in the inertia of daily living. And then, in what seems like the blink of an eye, the window of opportunity closes. 

Perhaps we hesitate because we fear failure. Yet the greatest risk is refusing to risk; the greatest failure is refusing to try—it means we will never taste that soufflé, see that dazzling vista, or enjoy that grand accomplishment. 

So how do we break free of our self-imposed limitations? We can start by trying something new. We can say hello to the withdrawn co-worker we’ve never spoken to. We can try a new food, or read a book by a new author. We can sing a song that has always seemed outside our range. We can sign up for a class we always wanted to take. We can use the vast offerings of the Internet to research a famous artist, find out about a recent scientific discovery, or start to learn a new language.   

Don’t wait until “someday.” Today is what we have. As a wise mother once said: “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” 

Like the soufflé, if we fall, we fall. But we’ll never know if we don’t try.

Episode 4463. Aired March 29, 2015*NewVideo*The First Girl Scout - The Spoken Word**EssMdrHGQAc**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EssMdrHGQAc/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Stories of admirable people often reveal that great achievements grow not from a life of ease and comfort but from the fertile seedbed of heartache and difficulty. The life of Juliette Gordon Low is one of those stories.  

Juliette, or Daisy, as she was known, was born just months before the outbreak of the American Civil War. Although reared in a happy home in Savannah, Georgia, Daisy soon became acquainted with sorrow—the death of her beloved little sister, recurring bouts of malaria and chronic ear infections, a physician’s error that severely damaged her hearing, and an unhappy marriage that ended when her husband died in 1905, leaving her a widow in her 40s. 

By this time Daisy was living in England and yearning for a sense of purpose. It was then that she became acquainted with British war hero Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts. With Baden-Powell’s encouragement, she returned to the United States and made a historic telephone call to a friend, saying, “I’ve got something for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and all the world, and we’re going to start it tonight!”

The American Girl Scouts movement that Daisy Low founded has since become the largest educational organization for girls in the world. Although Daisy had no children of her own, she has positively influenced tens of millions of lives. 

Scouting represented everything Daisy valued: duty to country, joy in the outdoors, a cheerful spirit, self-reliance, and service to others. She believed that all girls should be given the opportunity to develop physically, mentally, and spiritually. 

Daisy died of cancer in 1927 and, at her request, was buried in her Girl Scout uniform. In her pocket was a telegram that she received from the national officers of Girl Scouts shortly before she died. “You are not only the first Girl Scout,” it read, “you are the best Girl Scout of them all.” As her biographer wrote, it may seem preposterous “that a near-deaf fifty-one-year-old childless widow began the Girl Scouts.” Yet it happened, and millions of girls have sold cookies, had lots of fun, learned valuable skills, and been strengthened as a result.

La vida de Juliette Gordon Low es uno de tales relatos.

Juliette, o Daisy, como se le llamaba, nació pocos meses antes de que estallara la Guerra Civil en Estados Unidos. Aun cuando fue criada en un hogar feliz, Daisy pronto enfrentó duras pruebas —la muerte de su amada hermanita, continuos episodios de malaria e infecciones crónicas, un error médico que afectó su capacidad de oír, y un matrimonio infeliz que terminó al morir su esposo en 1905, cuando ella tenía sólo 40 años de edad.

Daisy vivía entonces en Inglaterra y sentía que su existencia carecía de mayor propósito. Entonces conoció al héroe de guerra británico, Robert Baden-Powell, fundador de los Boy Scouts. Con su apoyo, ella regresó a Estados Unidos e hizo una histórica llamada telefónica a una amiga, a quien le dijo que tenía una idea magnífica para las niñas de toda la nación y de todo el mundo, y que esa misma noche empezarían a darle forma.

El movimiento de las niñas exploradoras que Daisy Low fundó ha llegado a ser la mayor organización educativa para  jovencitas en el mundo, y aunque Daisy no tuvo hijos propios, sí que influyó para bien en decenas de millones de vidas.

El escultismo representaba todo cuanto Daisy valoraba: deber a la patria, amor por la naturaleza, un espíritu alegre, la autosuficiencia y el servicio a los demás. Ella creía que a toda niña se le debía dar la oportunidad de desarrollarse física, mental y espiritualmente.

Daisy murió de cáncer en 1927 y, a su pedido, fue sepultada en su uniforme de niña exploradora. En un bolsillo tenía un telegrama recibido poco después de fallecer. “Usted no sólo fue la primera niña exploradora”, decía, “sino la mejor de todas”. Como se escribió en su biografía, podría sonar absurdo “que una viuda casi sorda de 51 años y sin hijos organizara nuestro movimiento”. Pero así fue, y millones de niñas han vendido galletas, se han divertido mucho, han adquirido valiosas destrezas y, como resultado, se han visto fortalecidas.

A vida de Juliette Gordon Low é uma dessas histórias. 

Juliette, ou Daisy, como ficou conhecida, nasceu poucos meses antes do início da Guerra Civil Americana. Embora criada em um lar feliz em Savannah, Georgia, Daisy logo se familiarizou com a tristeza — a morte de sua amada irmãzinha, surtos de malária e infecções de ouvido, o erro de um médico que prejudicou severamente sua audição, e um casamento infeliz que terminou quando seu marido morreu em 1905, deixando-a viúva por volta dos 40 anos. 

Nesta época Daisy morava na Inglaterra e ansiava por um propósito na vida. Foi então que ela conheceu o herói de guerra britânico Robert Baden-Powell, fundador do escotismo. Com o incentivo de Baden-Powell, ela voltou para os Estados Unidos e deu um telefonema histórico para uma amiga, dizendo: “Tenho algo para as meninas de Savannah, de toda parte dos Estados Unidos da América e de todo o mundo, e vamos começar esta noite!”

O movimento Garotas Escoteiras Americanas, que Daisy Low fundou, tornou-se a maior organização educacional para meninas no mundo. Apesar de Daisy não ter seus próprios filhos, ela influenciou dezenas de milhões de vidas. 

O escotismo representava tudo o que Daisy valorizava: o dever a pátria, a alegria pela natureza, um espírito alegre, a autoconfiança e o serviço ao próximo. Ela acreditava que todas as meninas deveriam ter a oportunidade de se desenvolver física, mental e espiritualmente. 

Daisy morreu de câncer em 1927 e, a seu pedido, foi enterrada com seu uniforme de escoteira. Em seu bolso havia um telegrama recebido, antes de sua morte, dos dirigentes nacionais das Garotas Escoteiras. “Você não é apenas a primeira escoteira”, dizia ele, “você é a melhor de todas”. Como seu biógrafo escreveu, pode parecer absurdo “que uma viúva de 51 anos, sem filhos e praticamente surda tenha iniciado as Garotas Escoteiras”. Más aconteceu, e milhões delas venderam biscoitos, divertiram-se bastante, aprenderam habilidades valiosas e foram fortalecidas como resultado disso.

Sus saladas aguas no pueden nutrir ni plantas, ni peces ni otros animales.

A unos 160 kilómetros hacia el norte hay otro mar, el de Galilea. Sus frescas aguas han permitido la pesca comercial por más de 2.000 años. La vegetación crece libremente en sus costas, y su agua es bombeada para dar sustento a países contiguos.

La diferencia entre estos dos mares vecinos es que el Mar Muerto no tiene salida. Sus aguas provienen del río Jordán, pero no siguen ningún curso, manteniendo así la totalidad de su caudal. Como contraste, cada gota que recibe el Mar de Galilea, sale de él.

Hace mucho tiempo, el conocido autor Bruce Barton, advirtiendo esa diferencia, hizo la siguiente observación: “El Mar de Galilea da y vive. El otro mar no da absolutamente nada y por eso se le llama ‘Mar Muerto’. Hay dos clases de mares, y hay dos clases de gente”.

¿Somos nosotros la clase de personas que dan y que viven? ¿Hay quienes se ven fortalecidos y hasta reviven, al pasar tiempo con nosotros? ¿O agotamos la vida de los demás? Si tomamos más de lo que damos, hay formas sencillas de revertirlo. Podemos empezar hoy por hallar personas a quienes animar, ayudar o elevar.

Especialmente en estos días de Pascua, cuando celebramos la renovación, cuando nos regocijamos en la promesa de la vida abundante ofrecida por el Maestro que “anduvo haciendo bienes”, podemos detenernos a pensar que sólo al dar de nosotros realmente vivimos. El milagro de tal dádiva es que cuanto más damos, más tenemos para dar. Si, en cambio, nos guardamos las buenas obras, nos sentiremos vacíos. Hagamos, entonces, que la corriente fluya a nuestro favor, una gota de bondad a la vez.

As a result, it cannot support life. Neither plants nor fish or other animals can receive any nourishment from its salty waters.

Approximately 100 miles to the north is another sea, the Sea of Galilee. Its fresh water has supported commercial fishing for over 2,000 years. Plants grow freely along its shoreline, and water is pumped from the Sea of Galilee to supply drinking water to nearby countries. 

The difference between these two neighboring seas is that the Dead Sea has no outlet. Water flows in from the Jordan River, but no water flows out; it keeps every drop. By contrast, for every drop of water that the Sea of Galilee receives, it gives away in equal measure. 

Long ago, author Bruce Barton, noting this difference, made the following observation: “The Sea of Galilee gives and lives. The other sea gives nothing. It is named the ‘Dead Sea.’ There are two [kinds of] seas. … There are two kinds of people.”

Are we the kind of people who give—and live? Are other people strengthened, even enlivened, after spending time with us? Or do we drain the life out of others? If we find ourselves taking more than we’re giving, there are simple ways to reverse that trend. We can start today by finding someone to encourage, to help, or to uplift. 

Especially at this Easter season, when we celebrate renewal and rebirth, when we rejoice in the promise of the abundant life offered by the Master who “went about doing good,” we might pause to remember that only in giving of ourselves do we truly live. The miracle of such giving is that the more we give to others, the more we have to give. If, however, we withhold compliments, praise, or good works, we feel depleted. So turn the tide in your favor, and give of yourself to others—one drop of kindness at a time.

The common belief is that a person’s overall sense of well-being goes downhill as he or she gets older, but researchers are finding—and many older people themselves are discovering—that this is not necessarily the case. 

For example, as we age, wisdom and understanding can flourish. Intelligence can develop and expertise can deepen, which can enhance creativity and productivity. Friendships can become more meaningful as the passing years teach us to prioritize what matters most. One Stanford University professor said, “Contrary to the popular view that youth is the best time of life, the peak of emotional life may not occur until well into the seventh decade.” While youth may have advantages, good things can come with age.

Of course, growing older has its share of challenges and difficulties. And, if we continue to live, we’ll each get there. So how can we turn this remarkable season of life into truly “golden” years? 

Perhaps one suggestion is to focus more on what we can do than on what we cannot do. Age does come with limitations, but we all can do something. It doesn’t have to be grand or monumental to be worthwhile. We can look for small and simple ways to reach out to others—make a phone call, send a note, extend a helping hand, or show interest in another’s life. We can learn something new—go to a museum, listen to an audiobook that stretches our mind a bit, or take up a new interest or hobby. We can look for opportunities to share our lived experience and acquired knowledge. 

In other words, we can resolve to live life in crescendo, ever growing and always serving. Time will pass, no matter how we spend it—so let’s make the most of the time we’ve been given and live our days well.

Aired on January 25, 2015.*NewVideo*Al envejecer - Palabras de Inspiración**aYdUb_I_1L0**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aYdUb_I_1L0/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**De muchas maneras, la vida es mejor a medida que avanzamos en años, a veces de un modo sorprendente. Por lo general se piensa que decaemos con el paso de los años. Pero lo que los estudios están concluyendo —y muchas personas mayores descubriendo— es que ese no es siempre el caso.

Por ejemplo, al envejecer, la prudencia y el entendimiento quizá florezcan, la inteligencia aumente y la experiencia se profundice. Las amistades pueden llegar a ser más significativas al aprender a dar prioridad a las cosas de mayor valor. Un profesor de una prestigiosa universidad dijo: “Contrariamente a lo que muchos creen, que la juventud es la mejor etapa de la vida, tal vez no alcancemos la madurez emocional plena hasta, por lo menos, los setenta años de edad”. Si bien tiene sus ventajas el ser joven, lo mejor de la vida quizá llegue más tarde.

Claro que la edad trae consigo unos cuantos desafíos que todos viviremos tarde o temprano. Entonces, ¿qué podemos hacer para que esos sean los mejores años de nuestra vida?

Una buena sugerencia podría ser centrarnos más en lo que podemos que en lo que no podemos hacer. Los años traen sus limitaciones, pero todos podemos hacer algo. No tiene que ser nada extraordinario para que sea trascendente. Bastará con formas sencillas de llegar a los demás: una llamada, una nota, una mano de ayuda o una muestra de interés. Podemos aprender cosas nuevas, ir a un museo, leer o escuchar la grabación de un libro, o emprender un nuevo pasatiempo. También podemos buscar oportunidades de compartir nuestra experiencia y conocimiento.

En otras palabras, podemos decidir vivir con más y más entusiasmo, siempre creciendo y sirviendo. El tiempo transcurrirá no importa cómo lo usemos, así que saquemos de él el mayor provecho posible.

Muitos acreditam que o senso de bem estar diminui a medida que ficamos mais velhos, mas de acordo com os entendidos, e por sua própria experiencia, estão descobrindo que esse nem sempre é o caso.

Por exemplo, ao ficarmos mais idosos, a sabedoria e o entendimento floresce. A inteligencia se desenvolve e experiencia se aprofunda e ambas aguçam a criatividade. As amizades são mais significativas, pois o tempo ensina a dar valor ao que realmente importa. Um professor de uma famosa universidade disse: Contrário a opinião popular de que a juventude é o melhor período da vida, o auge emocional talvez não ocorra até os anos 70s.” Embora a juventude tenha suas vantagens, grandes coisas advem com a idade.

É claro, o passar do tempo trás suas cargas e desafios. Se vivermos o suficiente, passaremos por elas. Então pergunto: Como fazer desse período incrível o melhor tempo de nossa vida?

Minha sugestão é dar mais atenção naquilo que podemos fazer ao invéz daquilo que não podemos. A velhice trás suas limitações, mas todos podemos fazer algo. Não precisa ser gigantesco para ter valor. Podemos procurar por coisas pequenas e simples como tocar a vida de outros, um telefonema, uma carta, uma palavra de carinho. Podemos aprender algo novo, passear, visitar alguém, ler um livro, escrever um livro de memórias, desenvolver um hobi. Podemos buscar por oportunidades de compartilhar nossa vida e experiências adquidas ao longo do camilho. 

Em outras palavras, podemos tomar a decisão de ter uma vida produtiva, sempre servindo outros. O tempo passa, independente de como o gastamos, então vamos usá-lo em sua plenitude e fazer o melhor daquilo que nos foi dado.

In 1948, three years after World War II, Stalin made a grab for all of Eastern Europe, leaving over two million people in West Berlin isolated and desperate for basic necessities. To help relieve their suffering, the Allies began airlifting supplies. One of the pilots, Gail Halvorsen, met some destitute but hopeful West Berlin children through a barbed wire fence near the runway. He wished he could give them something—all he had was two sticks of gum. But when he saw how much they cherished this small gift, he got an idea. Soon Allied planes were delivering more than food and fuel. Gail and his fellow fliers began dropping candy tied to little parachutes to the children. Word quickly spread about the “Candy Bomber,” and before long people were sending handkerchiefs to serve as parachutes and candy manufacturers were donating millions of pounds of candy. Gail’s little idea had captured hearts everywhere.

Distinguished broadcaster Tom Brokaw spoke with Gail Halvorsen about the larger-than-life lessons behind those little parachutes of hope. 


Tom Brokaw: 
You grew up on a hardscrabble farm in Utah. Everything that you and your father and your family got, you had to earn.


Gail Halvorsen:
Absolutely.


Tom Brokaw: 
Then you get thrown into the Army Air Corps as a pilot, fighting the biggest war ever. And I think that probably helped you—on that moment when you took two sticks of gum and divided them into four parts. As your Dad said, “From little things big things can happen.”


Gail Halvorsen:
That’s certainly true, Tom. You know, when things are tough, you have to help people—your neighbors. I’d hurry and get through thinning our sugar beets on our field and help somebody else. And sometimes they wouldn’t have anything to give you, but you know you had to serve others. That fulfillment in life comes from service—getting outside yourself.

It’s the synergy, the synergy between service before self. And the responding gratitude, the expressed gratitude that comes back.

Service before self, gratitude and attitude.


Lloyd Newell:
Service is something we all can do, even in small ways, even in the worst of times. As the Candy Bomber demonstrated, “from little things big things can happen.”

En 1948, tres años después de concluir la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Stalin se adueñó de la Europa Oriental, sumiendo en la pobreza a dos millones de berlineses del oeste. Para aliviar su padecer, los aliados empezaron a llevarles provisiones por aire. Uno de los pilotos, Gail Halvorsen, conoció a unos cuantos niños indigentes aunque esperanzados en Berlín Occidental, a través de una alambrada. Deseaba darles algo, pero sólo tenía dos barras de goma de mascar. Cuando vio cuánto atesoraban su pequeño obsequio, se le ocurrió algo. En poco tiempo aquellos aviones suministraban más que alimentos y combustible. Gail y los otros pilotos empezaron a lanzar dulces para los niños en pequeños paracaídas. Al correrse la voz sobre el “Bombardero de dulces”, las grandes compañías empezaron a donar enormes cantidades de golosinas. La pequeña idea de Gail enterneció corazones por doquier.

El distinguido presentador periodístico Tom Brokaw habló con Gail Halvorsen sobre las sublimes lecciones aprendidas de aquella misión de esperanza.


Tom Brokaw: 
Usted creció en una humilde granja de Utah. Todo cuanto usted y su familia tenían, se lo ganaron a puro esfuerzo.


Gail Halvorsen:
Así es.


Tom Brokaw: 
Después es reclutado como piloto para combatir en la mayor guerra de la historia. Pero quizá la experiencia más grande fue cuando encontró dos barras de goma de mascar y las dio a unos niños. Como dijo su padre: “De cosas pequeñas a veces nacen las grandes.


Gail Halvorsen:
Eso es muy cierto, Tom. Ante toda circunstancia difícil uno debe ayudar a la gente —a sus vecinos. Yo me apuraba para terminar mi trabajo en el plantío de remolachas para ir a darle una mano a alguien más. A veces ellos no tenían nada para darle a uno, pero sabía que lo importante era ofrecerles servicio. Eso lo hace sentir magníficamente a uno —el ayudar a otras personas.

Yo pienso que el servicio a los demás debe estar antes que atender las necesidades propias.

Servir en todo momento, con una buena actitud.


Lloyd Newell:
Todos podemos servir, aún de formas pequeñas y en los peores momentos. Como lo demostró el bombardero de dulces, “de lo pequeño nace lo grande”.

Em 1948, três anos após a Segunda Guerra, Stalin apoderou-se da Europa Oriental, deixando mais de 2 milhões de pessoas isoladas e desesperadas na Berlim Ocidental, necessitadas de socorro básico. Para aliviar seu sofrimento, os aliados enviaram ajuda por via aérea. Gail Halvorsen conheceu algumas crianças necessitadas através de uma cerca de arame farpado perto da pista de pouso e decolagem. Ele queria dar-lhes alguma coisa, mas só tinha duas barrinhas de chicletes. Mas depois de ver como elas gostaram daquele pequeno presente, teve uma ideia. Pouco depois, os aviões aliados passaram a entregar mais do que comida e combustível. Gail e seus companheiros começaram a jogar do avião chocolates e doces presas a pequenos paraquedas, para as  crianças,. A novidade sobre o “Bombardeiro de Doces” espalhou-se rápido e logo as pessoas começaram a enviar lenços para servir de paraquedas e os fabricantes de doces doaram milhões de quilos de doces. A ideia de Gail comoveu o coração de muitos em vários lugares.

O famoso locutor Tom Brokaw falou com Gail Halvorsen sobre as lições de vida por trás dos pequenos paraquedas de esperança: 


Tom Brokaw: 
Você foi criado numa fazenda em Utah que produzia muito pouco. Tudo que você, seu pai e sua família tinham, tiveram de conquistar.


Gail Halvorsen:
Exatamente!


Tom Brokaw: 
Depois, você entrou para a Força Aérea como piloto na maior de todas as guerras. Acho que isso provavelmente o ajudou quando você olhou para os dois chicletes e os dividiu em quatro partes. Como disse o seu pai: “De pequenas coisas vêm as grandes”.


Gail Halvorsen:
Isso é verdade sim, Tom. Sabe, quando as coisas estão difíceis, você tem que ajudar as pessoas, o seu próximo. Eu procurava descascar logo as beterrabas da nossa plantação e depois ia ajudar quem precisasse. E às vezes eles não tinham nada para lhe dar, mas você sabia que tinha de ajudar os outros. Essa realização na vida vem de servir, de não pensar só em si mesmo.

É a sinergia, a sinergia entre o serviço que está diante de você e a resposta de gratidão que recebemos de volta das pessoas. 

Serviço altruísta, gratidão e atitude.


Lloyd Newell
Todos podem prestar serviço, fazendo pequenas coisas, mesmo na pior das épocas. Como demonstrou o criador do Bombardeiro de Doces: “de pequenas coisas vêm as grandes”.

In a variety of ways, our culture suggests that we need to be bold to be successful, talkative to be happy, even loud to be worth hearing. This message is so pervasive that those who are more introspective, private, and quiet can begin to feel ashamed of their personality traits. They may long to be the life of the party—not the one who sits in the corner, lost in thought. They might think they need to be the one with many friends—not the one who enjoys fewer but deeper relationships. The culture may lead them to think that it’s better to be the center of attention—not the one who is content to observe.

The truth is that much of this world’s most inspiring art, most important discoveries, most influential ideas, and most revolutionary inventions were the work of people who tended to be more quiet who did not seek the spotlight. In fact, it may be that the inclination to be quiet and deliberate and contemplative is more likely to foster such achievements than a bold, aggressive approach.
 
By some estimates, approximately half of us are more introverted than extroverted. And that feels about right. The world was not meant to consist of only one kind of person. Our lives are enriched by varieties of personalities and dispositions, likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses. We need thoughtful, cautious people just as much as we need daring risk-takers. We need introverts and extroverts and everything in between.

Most of us have a little of both in our natures anyway—traditional labels are too simplistic to truly define anyone. And our personality develops over time; nothing is forever fixed in place. When anyone neglects his or her talents, we all suffer. On the other hand, when everyone is encouraged to be authentic enough to develop their gifts and then selfless enough to share them, they unleash their potential, make meaningful contributions, and find contentment—and we’re all the better for it.

De muchos modos, nuestra cultura sugiere que debemos ser audaces para ser exitosos, locuaces para ser felices y hasta ruidosos para que se nos quiera oír. Tal noción es tan convincente que las personas reservadas pueden llegar a sentirse avergonzadas de su personalidad. Quisieran ser el centro de atención en vez de pasar inadvertidas. Tal vez piensen que deben tener muchos amigos en vez de apenas forjar unas pocas relaciones perdurables. Es posible que la cultura les haga pensar que hay más valor en la atención que se recibe que en la que se da. 

Lo cierto es que gran parte de las más inspiradoras obras de arte, los más importantes descubrimientos e ideas, y los más revolucionarios inventos, son el producto de personas reservadas que no buscaban despertar el elogio ajeno. De hecho, puede ser que la inclinación a ser pausado y reflexivo llegue a generar más de esos logros que el enfoque intrépido y decidido.

Se calcula que cerca de la mitad de los seres humanos somos más introvertidos que extrovertidos, y eso está bien. El mundo no tiene por qué consistir de personas todas iguales. Nos sirven las  personalidades variadas, los gustos distintos, las virtudes y las debilidades. Tenemos necesidad tanto de personas cautelosas como de aquellas que demuestran arrojo; de las introvertidas como de las joviales y todo otro tipo de personalidad entre esos extremos.

La mayoría de nosotros tiene un poco de ambas cosas en su naturaleza y nunca es provechoso catalogar a nadie de una u otra manera. La personalidad se va formando de a poco, y cuando alguien descuida sus talentos, todos sufrimos. Por otro lado, cuando llegamos a ser lo suficientemente genuinos como para desarrollar nuestros dones y después compartirlos, libramos nuestro potencial, hacemos contribuciones significativas y nos sentimos individual y colectivamente felices.

Episodio 4444. Transmitido el 16 de noviembre de 2014.*NewVideo*Precisamos de Todos - Palavras De Inspiraçäo**xYobMxInaVc**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xYobMxInaVc/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Vivemos numa sociedade que parece valorizar a personalidade mais expansiva, aventureira, em detrimento de outras. Nossa cultura sugere que precisamos ser ousados para ter sucesso, falar bastante para ser feliz, até falar alto para ser ouvidos. Essa ideia está tão difundida que pessoas mais introspectivas, mais reservadas podem sentir vergonha de seus traços de personalidade. Elas gostariam de ser aquele que anima a festa, não o que fica sentado num canto, perdido em seus próprios pensamentos. Podem achar que precisam ter muitos amigos, não alguém que possui poucos, mas que desfruta de amizades mais profundas. A cultura pode levá-los a pensar que é melhor ser o centro das atenções, não alguém que se satisfaz em observar.

A verdade é que muito da arte mais inspiradora deste mundo, a maioria das descobertas, a maior parte das ideias influentes e as invenções mais revolucionárias foram obra de pessoas mais reservadas, que não procuravam ser o foco das atenções. Na verdade, pode ser que a inclinação para um comportamento calmo, deliberado e contemplativo favoreça mais a realização de conquistas do que uma postura ousada e agressiva.
 
Há estimativas de que aproximadamente metade das pessoas seja mais introvertida do que extrovertida. E parece que é isso mesmo. O mundo não foi feito para só um tipo de pessoa. Nossa vida é enriquecida pela variedade de personalidades e temperamentos, gostos, pontos fortes e fraquezas. Precisamos de pessoas dadas à reflexão e cautelosas da mesma forma que as ousadas e aventureiras. Precisamos de introvertidos e extrovertidos e de tudo que se encaixa nesse meio.
 
A maioria de nós tem um pouco dos dois — os rótulos tradicionais são simplistas demais para realmente definir uma pessoa. E nossa personalidade se desenvolve com o tempo; nada permanece fixo para sempre. Quando alguém negligencia seus talentos, todos nós perdemos. Por outro lado, quando alguém é incentivado a ser autêntico o suficiente para desenvolver seus dons e ser altruísta a ponto de compartilhá-los, ele libera seu potencial, faz contribuições significativas e sente-se bem — e todos nós ganhamos com isso.

As its name suggests, Charles Dickens’s classic tale A Christmas Carol was written primarily for the Christmas season. However, its timeless message is fitting for any season of the year.

In the story, miserly old Ebenezer Scrooge, through a series of ghostly visitations, comes to realize how selfish he has been, and miraculously, his heart begins to soften and change. He is transformed into a generous, cheerful soul. The heartwarming story of Scrooge resonates so powerfully because it reminds us of the truth that anyone can change for the better.

But when we hear the word scrooge, what do we think of? We probably think of a “miserly person”—that’s even the way the dictionary defines it. We probably don’t think of “a person who was once miserly but who, when given a second chance, chose to reform his life and share his wealth with those less fortunate.” Everyone knows how wonderfully Scrooge’s story ends, but his name has forever entered our consciousness (and our dictionary) as the embodiment of what he once was—not what he ultimately became.

It’s a question worth considering: Do we sometimes define people in terms of who they have been rather than who they are or who they can become? Do we let people begin again and change over time, or do we lock people into their past? The past must never be allowed to hold the future hostage. Just as Scrooge changed, we too must celebrate every effort—including our own—to start anew and change for the better.

In the musical that bears his name, Scrooge sings of the opportunity for a second chance:

I will start anew,

I will make amends,

And I will make quite certain

That the story ends

On a note of hope.

Let us always remember that everyone’s life story—no matter how it began or how it’s going right now—has the potential to end on a note of hope.

Episode 4084. Aired December 16, 2007*NewVideo*Love Never Counts - The Spoken Word**Zrgwaz0zmeQ**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zrgwaz0zmeQ/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Love has no end and no limits. It remains when all else fails; it grows as hearts are knit together in the bonds of kindness, selflessness, and compassion; it simply endures. And just as true love never quits, it also never counts or itemizes—it flows freely from an abundant heart. As American pastor Charles Edward Jefferson observed: “When did a mother ever count the number of times she kissed her baby, and when did a friend ever catalogue the number of favors toward his friend, or when did a parent ever make a list of all the good things he gave his children? Love never counts. It is the nature of love to give, and to keep on giving, and then to devise new ways of larger giving, and to imagine still additional needs which may be supplied.”

Truly, love is giving. And the irony is that the more we give, the more our love expands, and our desire and capacity to give also increase. The virtues and qualities and habits of a loving heart grow within us. 

In the same way, love doesn’t keep a list of wrongs or offences. The Apostle Peter once asked, “How [often] shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?” Jesus’s answer, “Until seventy times seven,” was less about specific numbers and more an invitation to stop counting. Love, after all, never counts. 

We witness this truth every time we watch a worried parent patiently nursing a sick child back to health. Then, decades later, that same son or daughter gives similar loving care to the elderly parent—not out of a sense of indebtedness; simply out of love. The years may come and go, but the words and deeds of love are forever engraved in our hearts. Who can ever forget an act of love freely given? As we strive to show and grow our love, let us remember that our expressions of love are echoes of the continuous and unlimited love of God. For as we truly love, we come to know His perfect love.

Episode 4442. Aired November 2, 2014*NewVideo*El amor no es calculable - Palabras de Inspiración**CIl_x2PvbRw**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CIl_x2PvbRw/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**El amor no tiene límites, sino que permanece cuando todo lo demás falla; crece al entrelazarnos en actos de bondad, abnegación y compasión, y así como el amor nunca se agota, tampoco se le puede calcular ni detallar; apenas fluye libremente de un corazón pleno.

Como lo observó un conocido pastor norteamericano: “¿Cuándo contó una madre el número de veces que besó a su bebé, y cuándo una persona llevó la cuenta de los favores hechos a sus amigos o cuándo un padre hizo una lista de todas las cosas buenas que dio a sus hijos? El amor nunca se calcula. Su naturaleza es dar y seguir dando, y después buscar nuevas maneras de dar más e identificar necesidades adicionales que deban ser satisfechas”.

En verdad, amar es dar, pero, irónicamente, cuanto más damos, tanto más aumenta nuestro amor, así como nuestro anhelo y capacidad de dar. Las virtudes, las cualidades y los hábitos del corazón amoroso crecen en nosotros.

Del mismo modo, el amor no hace una lista de injusticias y ofensas. El apóstol Pedro preguntó una vez: “¿Cuántas veces perdonaré a mi hermano que peque contra mí? ¿Hasta siete?”. La respuesta de Jesús de “hasta setenta veces siete”, no fue tanto una cantidad específica sino una invitación a dejar de contar, ya que el amor no es calculable.

Comprobamos esta verdad cada vez que vemos a un padre o una madre atender tiernamente a un hijo enfermo para que mejore. Entonces, décadas después, ese mismo hijo o hija presta similar atención a sus ancianos padres —no por sentirse endeudado, sino simplemente por amor. Los años llegan y se marchan, pero las palabras y los hechos de amor quedan siempre grabados en el corazón. ¿Quién olvidará jamás un acto de amor puro?
Al tratar de demostrar nuestro amor, recordemos que tales expresiones son un eco del continuo e ilimitado amor de Dios, porque al amar verdaderamente, llegamos a conocer Su amor perfecto.

Episodio 4442. Transmite en 02 de noviembre 2014*NewVideo*O Amor Não Tem Limites - Palavras de Inspiraçāo**Aws1D1FP_W8**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Aws1D1FP_W8/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**O amor não tem fim, não tem limites. Quando tudo mais falha, ele prevalece; desenvolve-se à medida que corações se unem em laços de bondade, altruísmo e compaixão; ele nunca se entrega. E assim como o verdadeiro amor nunca falha, também não tem limites — ele flui livremente do coração generoso. 

Como observou o pastor americano Charles Edward Jefferson, “Alguma mãe alguma vez já contou quantas vezes beijou seu bebê? E que amigo já catalogou o número de favores que fez a outro amigo? Algum pai faz uma lista de todas as coisas boas que já deu aos filhos? O amor não se prende a isso. O ato de dar faz parte da natureza do amor, assim como continuar a dar, e depois descobrir novas maneiras de dar mais e ainda imaginar outras necessidades que possam ser supridas”.

Sem dúvida, amar é dar. E a ironia é que, quanto mais damos, mais amor temos e nossa capacidade ou nosso desejo de dar também aumenta. As virtudes, as qualidades e os hábitos de um coração amoroso crescem dentro de nós. 

Do mesmo modo, o amor não faz uma lista de erros e ofensas. O Apóstolo Pedro perguntou uma vez: “Senhor, até quantas vezes pecará meu irmão contra mim, e eu lhe perdoarei? Até sete?” A resposta de Jesus, “até setenta vezes sete” não foi tanto para determinar um número de vezes, mas um convite para parar de contar. Afinal, o amor não tem limites. 

Testemunhamos essa verdade todas as vezes que vemos um pai ou uma mãe preocupados, cuidando com paciência de um filho doente até vê-lo saudável. Décadas mais tarde, aquele mesmo filho ou filha retribui esse cuidado amoroso a um pai ou mãe idosos, não por sentir-se em dívida, mas porque os ama. Os anos podem vir e passar, mas as palavras e os atos de amor ficam gravados para sempre em nosso coração. Quem é que se esquece de um gesto de amor expressado com sinceridade?  Ao nos esforçarmos para mostrar nosso amor e fazê-lo crescer, lembremo-nos de que nossas expressões de amor são ecos do contínuo e ilimitado amor de Deus. Ao amarmos verdadeiramente, conhecemos Seu perfeito amor.

It’s one thing to take stock of blessings silently, to be thankful in your heart; it’s quite another to give voice to those feelings. Recently, social scientists confirmed this observation—they noted a slight increase in the happiness of people who wrote down their feelings of gratitude and a much more significant increase in those who verbally expressed their thanks. Their moods lifted and their overall contentment with life improved. 

Imagine how much happier we might feel if we simply made more of an effort to thank people—out loud? To tell them how they have influenced us for good? To share our gratitude more freely and readily—with loved ones or even strangers? 

Recently, a woman made great efforts to track down her kindergarten teacher of nearly 50 years ago. Back then, Thelma was a shy girl who spoke little English, but Mrs. Silverman believed in her. Little Thelma went on to earn a PhD and make great contributions as an educator herself. But she never forgot her kindergarten teacher. After years of searching, Thelma was reunited with Mrs. Silverman (now 83 years old) and could finally tell her—in person—how she felt. They talked for three hours, and Thelma expressed profound appreciation for the kindergarten teacher who shaped her life. Mrs. Silverman was overwhelmed. “[It] didn't just make my year,” she said. “It made my lifetime.”  

That’s the power of expressed thanks. 

Finally and perhaps most importantly, what about the Giver of all good gifts? What if we made more of an effort to thank God for His goodness—to pray and express our feelings of gratitude out loud? Perhaps that’s why the Psalmist penned this everlasting truth: “It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto [His] name.”3

Episódio 4437. Transmitido em 28 de setembro de 2014*NewVideo*Feed the Good Wolf - Spoken Word**gZ9a2EzrzTE**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gZ9a2EzrzTE/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**An old legend tells of a wise grandfather teaching his grandson about the importance of making good choices. “A fight is going on inside me,” he explained to the boy. “It’s a terrible fight between two wolves. One is evil: he is anger, greed, selfishness, resentment, lies, and pride.” The other,” he continued, “is good: he is joy, peace, love, hope, humility, truth, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you—and inside every other person as well.” 

The grandson listened intently and asked, “Which wolf will win?” 

The grandfather answered simply, “The one you feed.”

That wise grandfather understood that we each choose for ourselves whether we will nurture our good or bad inclinations. This ability to choose is among our greatest gifts, but with this gift comes the obligation to take responsibility for our choices and live with their consequences. Those consequences may not be immediate, but they are certain—as certain as the advantage a healthy wolf has over a starving one.

We’ve seen this in our own lives and in the lives of those around us. The person who chooses to hold on to hurt feelings and catalog offenses ends up with a well-fed wolf of bitterness and pessimism. Eventually, regret and sorrow always accompany dishonesty, immorality, and selfishness. On the other hand, when we choose to forgive, to love, to hope—even when circumstances seem hopeless—our life takes a completely different turn. We find more reason to hope, more people to love, and more forgiveness in our heart. 

Yes, ultimately our choices, good or bad, are uniquely ours. We can neither blame them on others nor pass them off to others. If the good wolf inside of us is to thrive, it will be because we choose to feed it—by acting in wisdom and good judgment, by living prudently and positively each day. In decisions large and small, we can choose to feed the good inside us.

Tal vez conozca a alguien cuya vida parezca ser muy feliz, exenta de pesares y de problemas, especialmente en comparación con la suya. Quizá esa persona goce de mejor salud, tenga un mejor empleo o más posesiones o prestigio. A lo mejor usted hubiera preferido vivir en otra época, cuando la vida parecía ser menos complicada y el estrés era más controlable.

Pero si usted pudiera pasar un día en la vida de otra persona, quizá descubriría que no estaba del todo enterado de su verdadera situación. Toda vida, en toda época, se ve afectada por un cierto grado de tribulación y ensombrecida por una cierta medida de penurias. Tal es la naturaleza de la vida.

Usted es la suma total de sus años, experiencias y relaciones. Sus antecedentes personales han contribuido a forjar la persona que es hoy y vive al amparo de toda la sabiduría acumulada y de las lecciones grabadas en el alma. Usted no sería quien en verdad es sin todo cuanto hay en su corazón y en su cabeza, todo lo cual le prepara para conquistar cuanto se le interponga en el camino. Como dice un refrán inglés: “Si todos nuestros problemas de una cuerda se colgaran, los tuyos tú escogerías y yo con los míos me quedaría”.

Tal vez al cumplir años desearíamos ser un poco más jóvenes, y es posible que al sentirnos agobiados quisiéramos vivir en una época pasada. Pero todos estamos aquí en este momento y en este lugar con un propósito, y algo que nos privaría de satisfacer ese propósito es el que prefiriéramos estar en otro lugar.

Éste es nuestro día. En realidad no podemos ir hacia atrás en el tiempo ni cambiar lugares con otra persona, pero sí podemos disfrutar del presente y hacer frente al futuro con fe. La sabiduría del salmista trasciende los siglos: “Éste es el día que hizo Jehová; [regocijémonos y alegrémonos] en él”.

Talvez você conheça uma pessoa cuja vida pareça ser muito feliz, livre de sofrimento, dor e dificuldade — principalmente quando comparada à sua. Talvez ela tenha uma saúde ou um trabalho melhor, pode ser que seja mais rica ou tenha  mais prestígio. Ou talvez você já desejou viver em uma época diferente da história, quando os dias pareciam mais simples e o estresse mais suportável. 

Mas se você pudesse passar um dia na vida de outra pessoa, você descobriria que as coisas são bem diferentes do que pareciam. Toda vida, em todas as épocas, tem suas dificuldades e tribulações, qie conduz a tristeza e ao estresse. Essa é a essência da vida. 


A verdade é que você é a soma total de todos os anos, as experiências e os relacionamentos que já vivenciou. Sua história ajudou a moldar a pessoa que você se tornou. Você vive e respira hoje com a sabedoria e as lições de vida que conquistou arduamente, incorporadas em sua alma. Você não seria você sem tudo o que está em seu coração e em sua mente. Tudo isso o qualifica de modo singular para vencer os desafios que enfrenta agora. Como diz o ditado “Cada um prepara a sua própria cama para dormir.”

Talvez ao fazer aniversário desejemos ter alguns anos a menos, e em dias estressantes desejemos viver em outra época. Mas cada um de nós está aqui, agora, neste lugar para um propósito, e algo que pode nos impedir de cumprir esse propósito é desejar estar em outro lugar. 

Esta é a nossa hora, nossa época. Não podemos voltar no tempo ou trocar de lugar com outra pessoa, mas podemos desfrutar o presente e encarar o futuro com fé. A sabedoria do salmista clama através dos tempos: “Este é o dia que fez o Senhor; regozijemo-nos, e alegremo-nos nele.

Maybe you know someone whose life appears to be so happy, so free from heartache, pain, and difficulty—especially when compared to yours. Perhaps he or she has better health, a more exciting job, or more possessions or prestige. Or maybe you’ve wished you could live in a different age of history, when times seemed simpler and stresses seemed more manageable. 

But if you were able to spend a day in another person’s life, you may discover that you didn’t know the whole story or hadn’t looked very deeply. Every life, in every era, is touched by some degree of trouble and tribulation, shaded by some measure of sorrow and stress. That’s the nature of life. 

The truth is, you are the sum total of your accumulated years, experiences, and relationships. Your background has helped to shape you into the person you’ve become. You live and breathe today with all the hard-won wisdom and life lessons embedded in your soul. You wouldn’t be you without all that is in your heart and head. All of this makes you uniquely qualified to conquer the challenges you now face. To quote a classic piece of homespun wisdom, “If all of our troubles were hung on a line, you’d take yours and I’d take mine.”

Perhaps on a birthday we might wish we were a few years younger, and perhaps on stressful days we might wish we could live in another time. But each of us is here at this time and in this place for a purpose, and one thing that can keep us from fulfilling that purpose is wishing we were somewhere else. 

This is our time, our season. We can’t really go back to another time or trade places with someone else, but we can enjoy the present and meet the future with faith. The wisdom of the Psalmist echoes through the ages: “This is the day which the Lord hath made; [let us] rejoice and be glad in it.”

En un partido de fútbol jamás reparamos en los que mantienen la grama, o en un mercado, en quienes abastecen los estantes con productos. De hecho, esta transmisión semanal no llegaría a ustedes de no ser por la labor de un gran número de dedicadas personas a quienes ustedes no ven. Ellas trabajan alejadas del aplauso y el elogio, pero dan todo de sí en provecho de causas dignas. Bien haríamos en darnos tiempo para reconocer las valiosas contribuciones de quienes trabajan, a menudo en forma anónima, por el bien común.

Es natural que prestemos más atención a la gente prominente — a los que están en posiciones de liderazgo visibles, a los actores en escena, a quienes reciben atención y ovaciones de pie. Pero detrás de ellos hay una multitud de personas que hacen lo suyo día tras día para respaldar el buen trabajo de otros seres humanos.

La mayoría de nosotros se parece más a los extras que a los protagonistas. Las candilejas alumbran a unos pocos, pero hay una satisfacción especial entre bastidores, donde aunamos esfuerzos con legiones de personas para hacer cosas importantes y a fin de contribuir significativamente al bien de los demás.

Entonces, la próxima vez que vaya al estadio, de compras al mercado o escuche a un coro cantar, haga una breve pausa y piense en quienes sin recibir ningún tipo de reconocimiento del público apoyan los esfuerzos de quienes sí lo reciben. Esas son las personas que lo hacen todo posible, y a ellas debemos mucho de cuanto amamos en la vida.

Elas são aquelas que trabalham por tras dos bastidore em eventos como um jogo de futebol, um musical ou até na compra de um simples yogurte na prateleira do mercado. Sem elas nada acontecería. De fato não teríamos essa transmissão sem as pessoas que não vemos. Elas trabalham sem receber os aplausos ou estarem no pauco, porém elas dão o melhor de si em causas grandes ou pequenas. Seria bom parar, de vez em quando, e reconhecer a valorosa contribuição daqueles que servem no anonimato para o bem de todos.

É natural prestar atenção naqueles que estão em posições visíveis de liderança, no pauco em meio as luzes, nas capas de revistas, naqueles que recebem os aplausos. Mas por tras deles há uma multidão de profissionais que trabalham tão duro como os demais, fazem o melhor que podem para servir de apoio ao sucesso dos demais.

A maioria de nós serve como suporte ao invés de sermos as estrelas. A fama vem para tão poucos. Porém existe um senso de satisfação que ocorre por tras dos bastidores, ao nos unirmos com a grande massa da humanidade no serviço ao próximo, contribuindo, amando e edificando relacionamentos.

Então, na próxima vez que assistir um filme, for ao estádio de futebol, escutar uma apresentação do coro, ou simplesmente comprar um yogurte, lembre-se dos que estão por tras dos bastidores que, sem reconhecimento ou aplausos, são também importantes. Eles fazem com que aconteça o grande show da vida.

They are the people working behind the scenes, and a football game, a Broadway musical, even a cup of yogurt on a market shelf—to cite just a few examples—could not happen without them. In fact, this broadcast would not be possible each week without a host of dedicated people whom you don’t see. They do their work away from the applause and the bright lights, but they offer their best to worthy causes large and small. We should pause regularly to acknowledge the valuable contributions of people who work, often anonymously, for the good of the whole. 

It’s natural that our focus would be on those out front—those in visible leadership positions, those on the stage, those who get the headlines, the attention, the standing ovations. But behind them are a multitude of others who go about their business, work just as hard, and do their best each day to support the good work of others. 

Most of us are more like the supporting cast than the popular star. The limelight of fame comes to so few. But there’s a special sense of satisfaction behind the scenes, where we join the great mass of humanity doing our best to live lives that matter, to make meaningful contributions, to love others and to build relationships. 

So perhaps the next time you watch a movie, see a football game, listen to a choir perform, or buy a cup of yogurt, pause for just a moment and think of those behind the scenes who, without applause or recognition, support the efforts of those out front. They make it all possible. We owe to them so much of what we love about life.

It was given on a rural battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the site of the deadliest battle of the Civil War.

It was in this setting that President Abraham Lincoln traveled by train to help dedicate the Soldiers’ National Cemetery on that 19th day of November 1863 before a crowd of 15,000 people. First on the program was the famous orator Edward Everett, a well-known former senator, governor, and president of Harvard. To thunderous applause, he spoke with a strong and authoritative voice for two hours. 

Then, in sharp contrast, Lincoln raised what one reporter called his “sharp, unmusical treble voice” and began: “Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” In fewer than 300 words, he exhorted all to remember those who “gave the last full measure of devotion” for the nation; he spoke of a new birth of freedom, under God, that would bring true equality; and he said that “government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.” The president finished his speech before a photographer could even set up his tripod and uncap the lens, before the crowd “realized he was fairly launched on what he had to say.” An observer noted the “almost shocking brevity” of the speech, and the initial response was underwhelming.1 

And yet, while the two-hour sermon that preceded him has largely been forgotten, the timeless truths Lincoln spoke that day persist in our memory and our way of life. There was, however, one statement he made in that short speech has proven not to be true. He said, “The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here.” To the contrary, 150 years later, we still remember and even commit to memory the Gettysburg Address. More important, we live the spirit of those stirring words as we honor those who uphold liberty and join in what Lincoln called the “unfinished work” of unity, equality, and freedom.

Aired November 10, 2013*NewVideo*Perfect Peace - The Spoken Word**kFbYMT4IC7s**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kFbYMT4IC7s/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Over 2,000 years ago, shepherds tending their flocks by night heard the herald angels’ song of peace on earth and good will toward men.  With haste they went to Bethlehem to see Jesus, the Prince of Peace, born in the most humble circumstances. When He grew to manhood, Jesus “went about doing good”  and teaching all who would hear Him of the pathway to peace in this life and to eternal peace in the life to come. 

Today, peace seems to be among the most difficult things to achieve. The ideal of “peace on earth” has been an elusive goal, as conflict surrounds us and differences in race and religion too often lead to discord, even violence. National border and property disputes disrupt peace, often forcing innocent victims to flee in search of safety.

And yet, as elusive as world peace may be, sometimes the peace that is most difficult to find is personal peace of mind. The stresses and strains of everyday life can rob us of the tranquility and contentment we yearn for.

Jesus taught that real peace comes through paying less attention to ourselves and our own needs and seeking instead to serve those around us. “Love one another; as I have loved you,” He taught.  Perhaps it is this spirit of giving that makes Christmas such a meaningful time of year. Generosity fills the hearts of so many, and it seems that the more we give, the more we receive—though not so much of material things but of true peace. 

This is the peace that those herald angels promised on that first Christmas night—the peace that comes from helping another and bringing happiness into someone’s life. This is the peace that Jesus promised when He said, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.”  This is the divine gift of Him whose birth so long ago heralded the peace that surpasses all understanding.

A menudo nuestros pies se mueven tan deprisa de una importante tarea a otra que el dedicar tiempo a pensar detenidamente en nuestro rumbo puede parecer tanto irrealista como innecesario.

Pero todos necesitamos tiempo para la reflexión, pues sin ella, perdemos perspectiva en nuestra existencia. Sin esas introspecciones ocasionales sobre nuestros valores y el lugar que ocupamos en el universo, careceremos de guía y propósito. El pensar en esas cosas nos da la oportunidad de hacer a un lado lo que no es importante y de buscar la forma de conectarnos más con Dios. Por cierto que la más significativa de las reflexiones está en la oración, la cual Ralph Waldo Emerson define como “la contemplación de las realidades de la vida desde la perspectiva más elevada”.

Un joven recuerda haber visto a su padre, un dotado orador y escritor, sentado en un muro próximo a su casa por un largo tiempo, “pensando y meditando en cosas que escribiría y diría. Para mi padre”, dijo el joven, “la vida era una gran aventura de reflexión”.

Ese hijo jamás olvidó aquella lección, y cuando él mismo llegó a ser un notorio líder y orador, exhortó a otras personas a “retirarse en la oscuridad de la noche, observar las estrellas, y meditar en cuanto al lugar que cada una ocupa en el eterno plan del Todopoderoso”, a hacer cual el salmista, quien al contemplar los “cielos, obra de [los dedos de Dios], la luna y las estrellas que [Él formó] “, preguntó, “¿Qué es el hombre para que tengas de él memoria?” (Salmos 8:3-4).

La meditación es un ejercicio espiritual y mental que eleva nuestros pensamientos de lo trivial a lo vital y de lo mundano a lo divino. Entonces, cuando llega el momento de volver a nuestros quehaceres cotidianos, lo hacemos con energía, enfoque y propósito renovados, descubriendo que ese breve y sagrado tiempo dedicado a la profunda reflexión, ciertamente valió la pena.

Muitas vezes, nossos pés deslocam-se tão rapidamente de uma tarefa a outra que ponderar durante o caminho pode parecer irreal — ou até mesmo um desperdício de tempo.

Mas, todos nós precisamos de um momento de reflexão e introspecção; sem ele, perdemos a perspectiva e o foco em nossa vida. Se, de tempos em tempos, não pensarmos profundamente sobre nossos valores e nosso lugar no universo, ficamos sem direção e senso de propósito. Ponderar nos dá a oportunidade de esclarecer as coisas, de deixar de lado o que não importa e buscar uma conexão com algo eterno — até mesmo com Deus. De fato, o mais significativo ato de ponderar inclui a oração, que Ralph Waldo Emerson definiu como “a contemplação dos fatos da vida do ponto de vista mais elevado.”

Um filho se lembra de ver o pai, um talentoso orador e escritor, sentar-se em um muro de pedra perto de casa durante o que pareceu horas — “a pensar, meditar e ponderar as coisas que ele iria dizer e escrever. (…) A vida era para ele uma grande aventura em pensamento”, recorda ele.

O filho nunca esqueceu essa lição e, quando ele se tornou um renomado líder, orador e escritor, incentivou as pessoas a “ir para a escuridão da noite, vislumbrar as estrelas e ponderar sobre seu lugar no plano eterno do Todo-Poderoso” — a fazer o que fez o salmista e “[ver] os (…) céus, obra dos (…) dedos [de Deus], a lua e as estrelas que [Ele preparou]” e perguntar: “Que é o homem mortal para que te lembres dele?” (Salmos 8:3-4).

Ponderar é o exercício mental e espiritual que eleva nossos pensamentos do trivial para o vital, do mundano para o divino. Depois, quando chegar o momento de voltar para nossas tarefas diárias, podemos fazê-lo com foco, energia e propósito renovados. E descobrimos que nosso breve e sagrado momento de profunda e humilde meditação foi um tempo bem utilizado.

Episódio 4438. Transmitido em 5 de outubro de 2014.*NewVideo*Time Well Spent - The Spoken Word**trzAwYYLfrI**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/trzAwYYLfrI/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**In Proverbs we read the admonition “Ponder the path of thy feet” (Proverbs 4:26). Often our feet move so quickly from one important task to another that thoughtfully pondering our path can seem unrealistic—or even a waste of time. 

But we all need some time for private reflection and introspection; without it, we lose perspective and focus in our lives. Without some occasional deep thinking about our values and our place in the universe, we lack direction and a sense of purpose. Pondering gives us an opportunity to sort things out, to set aside the unimportant and seek a connection with something eternal—even with God Himself. Indeed, the most meaningful pondering includes prayer, which Ralph Waldo Emerson defined as “the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view.”1 

A son remembers watching his father, a gifted speaker and writer, sit on a rock wall near his home for what seemed like hours—“thinking, meditating, pondering things that he would say and write. … Life was for him a great adventure in thinking,” he recalled. 

The son never forgot that lesson, and when he became a noted leader, speaker, and writer in his own right, he encouraged people to “go out into the dark of the night, look at the stars, and ponder their place in the eternal plan of the Almighty”—to do as the Psalmist did and “consider [the] heavens, the work of [God’s] fingers, the moon and the stars, which [He has] ordained,” and ask, “What is man, that thou art mindful of him?” (Psalm 8:3–4).2

Pondering is spiritual and mental exercise that elevates our thoughts from the trivial to the vital, from the mundane to the divine. Then when the time comes, as it always does, to return to our daily tasks, we do so with renewed focus, purpose, and energy. And we find that our brief, sacred moment of deep and humble pondering was indeed time well spent.

Al igual que las corrientes hallan obstrucciones, a menudo enfrentamos los obstáculos de las discordancias. Aprender a lidiar con ellos es esencial para la felicidad. A veces seguimos nuestro curso alrededor de ellos, mientras que otras nos vemos atrapados en algún remolino que no nos permite avanzar o, peor aún, que nos inmoviliza por completo.

Hay quienes dicen que la discordia es inevitable o parte de la vida, pero la contención jamás resulta en nada positivo, sino que nos distrae de nuestras metas, nos priva de sentir paz, y hasta puede destruir relaciones. Nunca nadie triunfa en una discusión; ambas partes salen perdedoras.

Hay veces que queremos convencer a alguien de que vea las cosas como nosotros. Si podemos hacerlo con bondad y respeto, tal vez lo logremos. Pero el discutir no convence a nadie de la validez de nuestra posición, sino que los convence de nuestra disposición.

¿Será que a veces valoramos el debate airado más que el acuerdo sensato? Tal vez debiéramos ser más como la maestra que premió a los alumnos que podían mediar en desacuerdos y hacer que sus compañeros de clase analizaran con calma las otras posiciones. O como la pareja que descubrió que cuando escribían sus sentimientos antes de compartirlos, veían cuán hirientes iban a ser algunos de sus comentarios, y los cambiaban por algo más amoroso.

Los desacuerdos y las diferencias son inevitables, pero no tienen por qué llevar a la contención y a la ira. Podemos escuchar con el corazón, responder con respeto y disminuir el acaloramiento cuando vemos que aumenta la tensión. Al considerar las perspectivas ajenas, podemos evitar el orgullo que convierte a seres queridos en contrincantes. Y si aún discordamos con ellos, podemos hacerlo con respeto en vez de hostilidad. No vale la pena entablar una querella. Descubrimos una mayor medida de paz y dicha cuando ponemos la compasión por encima de la contención y a la gente por encima de las opiniones.

Assim como um riacho fica turbulento ao passar pelas pedras que se encontram no seu leito, nós também encontramos pessoas com diferentes opiniões. Aprender como lidar com esses obstáculos é esencial para uma vida feliz. As vezes evitamos essas pessoas. Outras vezes nos encontramos em um redemoinho, incapaz de proseguir adiante.

Alguns pensam que a discordia é inevitável, e simplesmente faz parte da vida. Más aceitar a contenda nunca tráz resultados positivos, ao contrario, afásta-nos de nossas metas, tira a felicidade e a paz e até destroi relacionamentos. Numa discussão não há vencedores; ambos perdem.

Existem momentos onde queremos forçar alguém a ver as coisas da nossa maneira. Isso até pode ser feito se usarmos a bondade e o respeito. Porém a contenda não conduz ninguém a ver o nosso ponto de vista; muito pelo contrario.

Será que damos mais valor a um debate bem argumentado em lugar de sensível e pacificadora? Talvez deveríamos ser com o professor que deu pontos extras ao aluno que serviu como pediador e pacificador da clase durande um desentendimento. Ou um casal que antes de expressar suas frustações em palavras, decidiu escrevê-las e revisá-las e mudar as frases que seriam ofensivas, substituindo-as por palavras mais amáveis.

As diferenças de opiniões são inevitáveis, mas elas não devem conduzir a contenda e a raiva. Podemos escolher escutar com nossos corações, responder com respeito e diminuir o calor da tenção. Ao pensarmos nos sentimentos e nas opiniões dos outros, podemos evitar que o orgulho que muda aqueles a quem amamos em inimigos. E no final, se não concordamos com eles, podemos fazê-lo de maneira amável e respeitosa, não com pedras nas mãos. Não vale a pena brigar. Encontraremos mais paz e alegría ao colocamos a compaixão antes da contenda e as pessoas antes na nossa propia opinião.

Like a brook that bubbles over rocks and obstructions, we frequently bump up against those who disagree with us. Learning how to deal with such obstacles is essential to happy living. Sometimes we navigate around them, proceeding on our way. Other times we find ourselves swirling in an eddy, unable to go forward—or worse, immobile and stagnant.

Some say that discord is inevitable, simply a part of life. But engaging in contention never yields a positive outcome. Rather, it distracts us from our goals, robs us of contentment and peace, and can even destroy relationships. No one ever wins a quarrel; both sides ultimately lose.

There are times when we want to persuade someone to see things our way. And if we can do so with kindness and respect, we have a chance. But arguing does not convince others of our position; it only convinces them of our disposition.

Do we sometimes value skillful debating over sensitive peacemaking? Perhaps we should be more like the schoolteacher who gave extra credit to students who could mediate a disagreement and get classmates to calm down and see the other side of things. Or like the couple who found that when they wrote down their feelings before sharing them, they were able to see how hurtful some of their comments were and revised them to be more loving. 

Disagreements and differences are inevitable, but they don’t have to lead to contention or anger. We can choose to listen with our hearts, respond with respect, and turn down the heat when we sense tensions rising. By considering the feelings and perspectives of others, we can avoid the pride that turns our loved ones and associates into our opponents. Then, if we disagree with them, we can do so with love and respect, not hostility and contention. It’s not worth engaging in battle.

Los niños pequeños tienen sus ocupaciones: aprender a caminar, a hablar y a comer. Los adolescentes aprenden a ser responsables y desarrollan sus talentos. Los adultos aplican tales destrezas en provecho de sus familias y de la comunidad. La verdadera recompensa por trabajar no es un sueldo, sino vivir.

Nuestras labores no se miden por lo hecho dentro de un horario ni se limitan al lugar de empleo. Todo cuanto hacemos es trabajo: las tareas de la casa, de la escuela, las que nos proveen sustento y las que nos dan satisfacción. Ofrecemos servicio en nuestras iglesias, en las comunidades donde vivimos y hacemos cuanto podemos por el necesitado. Trabajamos para estar en buen estado físico y también para vigorizar la mente y el intelecto.

Theodore Roosevelt, el vigésimo sexto Presidente de los Estados Unidos, creció enfermizo en un hogar opulento de Nueva York. En sus circunstancias, bien podría haber escogido una vida apática y fácil, pero no lo hizo. Se esforzó por vencer sus padecimientos; llegó a ser un fervoroso amante de la naturaleza y un tenaz deportista; un arrojado militar y un exitoso político. Como gobernador de Nueva York predicó lo que él llamó “la doctrina de la vida ardua, de esfuerzo, de trabajo y de lucha”. Tal actitud lo impulsó al puesto de vicepresidente y más tarde al de presidente de su país. La esfinge de Roosevelt tallada en la roca del Monte Rushmore es un testimonio de su convicción de que “por sobre todo lo demás, el mejor premio que la vida ofrece es la oportunidad de producir obras dignas del esfuerzo”.

¿Es así como nos sentimos hacia nuestro trabajo? ¿Son nuestras labores nobles y dignas? ¿Estamos “anhelosamente consagrados a una causa buena”? Tanto en la política como en el hogar, el premio es el mismo: “la oportunidad de producir obras dignas del esfuerzo”.

E as crianças não estão isentas dele ao aprenderem a andar, a falar e até usar uma colher. Os jovens trabalham ao desenvolver responsabilidade e ao descobrir seus talentos. Os adultos trabalham aplicando esses talentos para fazer a diferença em sua família e na comunidade. A verdadeira recompensa pelo trabalho não é monetário — é a vida!

O trabalho não é medido das oito as cinco. Será que todo lugar não é um local de trabalho? Há tarefas de casa e da escola, o trabalho de equipe e o remunerado. Trabalhamos no jardim e em nossa igreja; trabalhamos para obter uma formação; trabalhamos ao ser gentis uns com os outros e ao servirmos aos necessitados. Trabalhamos para ficar em forma e mudar como éramos ontem. Trabalhamos ao fazer algo de nossa vida. 

Theodore Roosevelt, 26 presidente dos Estados Unidos, cresceu como uma criança doente em uma família rica de Nova York. Devido a isso, ele poderia ter escolhido uma vida de preguiça e cheia de facilidades. Mas ele não o fez. Trabalhou para superar seus males; Tornou-se um homem que vivia ao ar livre e um atleta tenaz; levou a cavalaria Rough Riders até o monte de San Juan e se tornou um político de sucesso. Como governador de Nova York, pregou o que chamava de “doutrina da vida árdua, a vida do trabalho e do esforço, do labor e da luta”. Essa atitude o levou ao cargo de vice-presidente e, posteriormente, de presidente de seu país. O rosto de Roosevelt esculpido em granito no monte Rushmore é um testemunho de sua convicção de que “de longe o melhor prêmio que a vida oferece é a chance de trabalhar duro em um trabalho que vale a pena.”

É assim que nos sentimos em relação ao nosso trabalho? Ele enobrece e contribui para algo? Vale a pena? Estamos “[ocupados] zelosamente em uma boa causa”? Se nossa boa causa envolve a política ou as prioridades familiares, o prêmio é o mesmo: “a chance de trabalhar duro em um trabalho que vale a pena”.

Toddlers have their work too: learning to walk and speak and use a spoon. Teenagers work at learning responsibility and at discovering and developing their talents. Adults work at applying those talents to make a difference in their families and the community. The true reward for work is not a paycheck—it is life!

Work isn’t measured nine to five any more than is it reserved for what we often call the workplace. Isn’t every place a place of work? There’s housework and homework, teamwork and paid work. We work in the garden and in our churches; we work at getting an education; we work at being kind to one another, at selflessly serving those in need. We work at getting in shape and getting past where we were yesterday. We work at making something of our lives. 

Theodore Roosevelt, 26th president of the United States, grew up a sickly child of a wealthy New York family. In those circumstances, he could have chosen a life of laziness and ease. But he didn’t. He worked at overcoming his maladies; he became a devoted outdoorsman and tenacious athlete; he led the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill; he became a successful politician. As governor of New York he preached what he called the “doctrine of the strenuous life, the life of toil and effort, of labor and strife.”  That attitude propelled him to the office of vice president and eventually president of his country. The granite face of Roosevelt carved on Mount Rushmore is a testimonial to his conviction that “far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.” 

Is that the way we feel about our work? Is it ennobling and contributing; is it worthwhile? Are we “anxiously engaged in a good cause”?  Whether our good cause involves national politics or family priorities, the prize is the same: “the chance to work hard at work worth doing.”

Aunque las despedidas a veces nos destrozan el corazón, volver a encontrarnos con seres queridos puede que sea uno de los momentos más magníficos de la vida.

Por eso los aeropuertos tal vez sean los lugares donde se hallan los sentimientos más encontrados de tristeza y de alegría, dependiendo de la dirección del viajero. Quienes estuvieron ausentes y ahora retornan son estrechados en amorosos brazos. Muchos hasta ese momento cansados parecen llenarse de vigor al ver a quienes aguardan por ellos. No importa si han estado lejos por pocos días o por años, las bienvenidas son momentos siempre atesorados.

En realidad, continuamente nos marchamos o regresamos, y puesto que la vida es breve, debemos sacar el mayor provecho de cada bienvenida y, como el padre en la parábola del hijo pródigo, podemos aguardar constantemente esos recibimientos aun cuando parezcan distantes.

Una mujer mayor nunca olvidará el día en que la familia de su hija, que vivía del otro lado del país, llegó a hacerle una visita inesperada. Aunque no estaba preparada para recibirles, se apoderó de ella una alegría indescriptible al ver a sus seres queridos. Los cobijó en sus amorosos brazos, les preparó sus comidas predilectas y se aseguró de que estuvieran cómodos en su casa. Se sentía encantada con ellos, en especial con sus nietos. Como hacía tiempo que no los veía, aprovechaba toda oportunidad para abrazarlos. Todos se sintieron bien acogidos, como si nunca hubieran estado lejos; se sintieron bienvenidos.

¿No sería magnífico si todos, pródigos o no, pudieran regresar a su hogar y hallar palabras de bondad, corazones cálidos y amorosos abrazos? ¿Es posible que todos cuantos están lejos hallen algún día brazos extendidos que les den dulces bienvenidas?

Enquanto algumas vezes dizer adeus corte o coração, nos  reunirmos com nossos distantes amados está entre os melhores momentos da vida. 

Por esse motivo, os aeroportos podem ser os lugares mais felizes ou tristes, com despedidas e saudações que trazem lágrimas aos olhos e dão um nó na garganta. Militares que voltam são abraçados alegremente, entes queridos que retornam são recebidos com os braços abertos e viajantes cansados são rejuvenescidos ao verem a família ou os amigos. Não importa se estiveram fora por alguns dias ou por anos — as boas-vindas são momentos incomparáveis.

Na verdade, sempre estamos dizendo “adeus” e “olá”. E já que a vida é curta, precisamos aproveitar ao máximo cada retorno. Como o pai na parábola do filho pródigo, podemos constantemente ansiar por tais voltas ao lar, mesmo que pareçam “muito distantes”.

Uma avó nunca esquecerá o dia em que a família de sua filha, que morava do outro lado do país, chegou para uma visita surpresa. Ela não sabia que eles viriam e ficou extremamente emocionada ao vê-los. Eles estavam em casa! Ela os fez bem-vindos com seus braços cheios de amor; preparou seus pratos favoritos e se assegurou de que todos estivessem confortáveis e felizes. Ela não conseguia parar de abraçá-los — especialmente os netos. Um longo tempo havia passado e então ela não deixou passar nenhuma oportunidade de envolvê-los em seus braços. A família sentiu-se em casa — como se nunca estivessem estado fora. Eles eram bem-vindos.

Não seria maravilhoso se todos, pródigos ou não, pudessem voltar para casa e encontrar palavras doces, corações calorosos e um abraço amoroso? É possível que todos os que estão longe de casa possam um dia, de alguma maneira, encontrar braços abertos de boas-vindas?

While saying goodbye can be heart-wrenching at times, reconnecting with loved ones we haven’t seen in a while can be among life’s greatest moments. 

For this reason, airports can be the happiest and the saddest of places—full of goodbyes and hellos that bring a tear to the eye and a lump to the throat. Soldiers returning from active service are joyously embraced. Loved ones away for a season are welcomed into open arms. And weary travelers are almost instantly rejuvenated by the sight of their family or friends. It matters not if they’ve been away for a few days or a few years—welcome-homes are moments to cherish.

In reality, we are continually saying goodbye and hello. And because life is short, we must make the most of each homecoming. Like the father in the parable of the prodigal son, we can be constantly looking forward to such homecomings, even if they seem to be “a great way off.”2

One grandmother will never forget the day her daughter’s family, who lived across the country, knocked on her door for a surprise visit. She didn’t know they were coming, but she could not have been more thrilled to see them. They were home! She welcomed them into her loving arms; she prepared their favorite foods; she made sure they were warm and comfortable and happy. She could not stop hugging them—especially the grandchildren. It had been too long since she was able to hold them close, so she did not let an opportunity pass to wrap her arms around them. The family felt like they belonged—like they had never been away. They were welcomed home.

Wouldn’t it be wonderful if everyone, prodigal or not, could return home and find kind words, warm hearts, and a loving embrace? Is it possible that all those away from home could someday, somehow find the open arms of welcome- homes?

Él jamás pospondría ni siquiera una insignificante reparación, ya que ésta no sólo ahorraría el costo de una mayor más tarde, sino que podría también salvar la vida de sus pasajeros.

Esto parece lógico cuando se aplica a naves averiadas, pero muchos de nosotros no tomamos similares medidas al advertir pequeños daños en nuestras relaciones. A menudo parece ser más sencillo descartar ciertos problemas, confiando en que se resuelvan solos, pero nuestras relaciones son mucho más importantes que barcos, motores, techos u otras cosas que atraen nuestra atención apenas algo de cuidado ocurre.

Los vínculos con seres queridos son una parte vital de la vida. Tales relaciones merecen nuestros mejores esfuerzos, aun cuando resulte incómodo sentarnos para tratar de solucionar juntos nuestras dificultades. Si posponemos ese proceso de reparación, aprenderemos, muy tarde, la validez del antiguo refrán que dice: “Más vale prevenir que lamentar”, en otras palabras, un esfuerzo atinado ya, puede evitar una crisis más tarde.

Un hombre lleva a cabo con su esposa e hijos lo que él llama una “reunión de mantenimiento” mensual. Al aclarar malos entendidos, mientras están aún frescos, estima que puede enmendar los malos sentimientos antes de que se vuelvan resentimiento. Él muestra su interés, se disculpa, si es necesario, y mantiene la armonía en la familia. Sus hijos aguardan ansiosos esas conversaciones con su papá, pues saben que serán escuchados, respetados y valorados. De ese ejemplo ellos han aprendido a atesorar relaciones y a reparar pequeños problemas antes de que lleguen a ser grandes.

Todos podemos hacer algo similar en el hogar, el trabajo o donde sea. Cuando sospechamos que alguien se siente mortificado, en vez de olvidarlo, con amor y respeto podemos invitar a esa persona a hablar del asunto. Así evitaremos posibles desastres, y, como el prudente capitán del barco, mantendremos nuestras relaciones a salvo.

Ele sabe que um pequeno vazamento hoje pode amanhã tornar-se grande e afundar seu navio. Ele não adiaria um conserto, por menor que fosse, e assim evitando não apenas um reparo mais caro no futuro mas como também garantindo a vida de seus passageiros.

Isso parece lógico quando relacionado aos barcos, mas muitos de nós não agimos imediatamente quando pequenos “vazamentos” aparecem em nossos relacionamentos. As vezes parece mais fácil ignorar os probleminhas, esperando que eles se resolvam e desapareçam. Os relacionamentos entretanto são infinitamente mais importantes do que as coisas que precisam ser concertadas na casa ou no carro. 

Nossos elos familiares e de amizade podem ser a fonte principal de alegria em nossas vidas. Tais relacionamentos merecem toda a atenção, mesmo que pareça chato ter que sentar e resolver essas dificuldades. Se adiarmos esse processo de conserto, aprendemos, muito tarde, que o antigo ditado é verdadeiro: Não deixes para amanhã o que podes fazer hoje ou seja, um esforço imediato pode evitar uma crise futura. 

Certo pai pediu a sua esposa e seus filhos que fizessem com ele todos os meses, uma “reunião de manutenção”. Ao falar sobre os mal-entendidos, enquanto recentes, ele viu que era mais fácil acalmá-los antes que se tornassem em problemas maiores. Ele pode demonstrar sua preocupação, pedir desculpas se necessário e manter a harmonia familiar. Seus filhos aguardam ansiosamente a reunião mensal com o papai. Eles sabem que suas vozes serão ouvidas, respeitadas e valorizadas. Eles aprenderam, pelo exemplo do pai, a cuidar da familia e reparar pequenos problemas antes que ficassem grandes.

Podemos fazer o mesmo em nosso lar, no trabalho e em qualquer lugar em que estivermos. Ao notarmos uma pessoa triste ou zangada, em vez de ficarmos indiferentes, podemos, com amor e respeito, conversar com ela sobre isso. Desta forma, evitaremos grandes catástrofes e, como o prudente capitão, não afundar os relacionamentos.

He knows that a small leak today can grow into a sizeable hole tomorrow and sink the boat. He would never postpone even a small fix, because it could not only save a costly repair later but could also save the very lives of his passengers.

This seems logical and responsible when applied to leaky ships, but many of us don’t take similar immediate action when small cracks appear in our relationships. Too often it seems easier to ignore little problems, hoping they’ll just resolve themselves and go away. Yet our relationships are infinitely more important than boats, car engines, rooftops, or other things that get our attention the minute trouble arises.

Our connections with family members and friends can be the central satisfaction of our lives. These relationships deserve our finest efforts, even when it may be uncomfortable to sit down and iron out difficulties together. If we procrastinate this mending process, we learn, too late, that the old idiom is true: A stitch in time saves nine. In other words, a timely effort now can avert a crisis later.
One man asks his wife and children to have what he calls a “maintenance meeting” with him once a month. By asking about misunderstandings when they’re fresh, he finds he can smooth over hurt feelings before they grow into resentment. He can show he cares, apologize if necessary, and keep harmony in the family. His children now look forward to their monthly appointments with Dad. They know their voices will be heard, their opinions respected and valued. And they’ve learned, from their father’s example, to cherish relationships and to fix small problems before they become big ones.

We can take a similar approach in our homes, in the workplace, wherever we are. When we wonder if someone is hurt or upset, instead of shrugging it off, we can, with love and respect, invite them to talk about it. In this way, we can ward off potential disaster and, like the wise captain of an airtight ship, keep our relationships afloat.

Episode 4430. Aired August 10, 2014*NewVideo*Un poco más bondadosos - Palabras de Inspiración**UoCxVypAHoI**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UoCxVypAHoI/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Algo que el mundo necesita más es bondad. Nuestros contactos diarios nos dan oportunidades ilimitadas de tener más paciencia, ser más considerados, de perdonar, y ser más compasivos; en otras palabras, tener más bondad.

Un breve poema de autor anónimo bien transmite ese sentimiento:

En la noche he llorado
por haber hecho a un lado
a quien pasa por gran necesidad;
mas nunca mal me sentí
ni me arrepentí
por mostrar bondad.

Quizá las demandas de la vida nos hacen ciegos a las necesidades de quienes nos rodean. Cuando nos ocupamos demasiado de nosotros mismos, es fácil olvidar que todos apreciamos la bondad básica del ser humano. Y aunque todos nos hemos sentido mal por no ser muy bondadosos, podemos decidir abrir los ojos y, más importante aún, abrir el corazón, para demostrar más bondad a los demás.

Todo aquel que trata de hacerlo —en el hogar, en el trabajo, en la comunidad—descubre lo mismo, que cuando llevamos a la práctica la bondad genuina, otras cualidades, como el respeto, la honradez, la confianza, la justicia y el afecto, también florecen. 

Si carecemos de bondad, nada positivo puede echar raíces.

Podemos tener puntos de vista diferentes, tal vez no estemos de acuerdo en muchas cosas, o quizá tengamos personalidades e intereses distintos, pero todos necesitamos bondad. Un conocido autor norteamericano dijo que todos llevamos en nuestro interior “el poder de incrementar la suma total de la felicidad del mundo… si expresamos unas pocas palabras de agradecimiento a alguien que se siente solo o desconsolado. Tal vez olvidemos mañana”, añadió, “las palabras que digamos hoy, pero quien las recibe las atesorará por siempre”.

Jamás olvidamos la bondad en palabras o en hechos, y jamás nos arrepentiremos por mostrar bondad.

Episodio 4430. Transmitido el 10 de agosto de 2014.*NewVideo*A Little More Kind - The Spoken Word**Fef784UMF94**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fef784UMF94/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**One thing this world needs more of is kindness. Our daily interactions provide limitless opportunities for more patience, thoughtfulness, forgiveness, and compassion: in other words, more kindness. 

A short poem by an unknown author conveys this sentiment well:

I have wept in the night
For the shortness of sight
That to somebody’s need made me blind;
But I never have yet
Felt a tinge of regret
For being a little too kind.1

Perhaps the pressing demands on our time are what make us blind to the needs around us. When we’re preoccupied with ourselves, it’s easy to forget that everyone has the same basic needs—we all need and appreciate basic human kindness. And though we’ve all felt a “tinge of regret” for being a little less than kind, we can resolve to open our eyes, and more importantly our hearts, to be a little more kind in our interactions. 

Everyone who tries to do this—in homes, in workplaces, in communities—discovers the same thing: When we simply practice genuine kindness, other desirable qualities—respect, honesty, trust, fairness, and affection—all blossom and grow. In the absence of kindness, nothing very positive can take root or flourish. 

We might have different views on any aspect of life, we might disagree on a range of issues, or we might have diverse personalities and interests—but we all have the need for kindness. The well-known American writer and speaker Dale Carnegie shared his belief that we all have within ourselves the “power to increase the sum total of [the] world’s happiness … by giving a few words of sincere appreciation to someone who is lonely or discouraged. … Perhaps you will forget tomorrow the kind words you say today, but the recipient may cherish them over a lifetime.”2

We never forget kindness in word or deed. And we will never regret being a little too kind.

2. In Thomas S. Monson, “Love—the Essence of the Gospel,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2014, 93–94.

Una adolescente irlandesa de nombre Annie Moore, fue el primer inmigrante en registrarse en la flamante estación de entrada de la Isla Ellis. Ella y sus dos hermanos menores, Anthony y Phillip, viajaron en tercera clase por 12 días en un barco a vapor para juntarse con sus padres, quienes  habían llegado a Estados Unidos con anterioridad.

En los siguientes 62 años, 12 millones de personas llegaron a este país a través de la Isla Ellis, y se calcula que cerca del 40 por ciento de los estadounidenses pueden hoy trazar su línea ancestral hasta alguien que pasó por ese punto de acceso para iniciar una nueva vida.

En la Isla Ellis ya no se registra a nuevos inmigrantes; siendo hoy su principal edificio un museo. Los visitantes pueden buscar en millones de registros para averiguar sobre la historia de su familia. Pero la verdadera historia está detrás de los nombres, las fechas y los lugares, en el despliegue en sí de la vida de esas personas —los hechos que dieron curso a sus vidas, sus esperanzas y expectativas, sus dichas, sus pesares, y su pura determinación.

Al enterarnos de sus relatos, estamos mejor preparados para lanzarnos a una nueva era, ya que ellos magnifican la experiencia del diario vivir. En las historias como las de Annie Moore, nos vemos a nosotros mismos. El historiador David McCullough, un gran amigo del Coro del Tabernáculo, lo dijo de este modo: “Como pocas otras cosas lo hacen, la historia nos inspira y nos da la oportunidad de comprender cuán relativamente breve y valioso es nuestro tiempo en la tierra”.

Los relatos de quienes nos antecedieron, por más extraordinarios o sencillos que sean, forman el fundamento de nuestra existencia. Cualquier cosa que logremos hoy, se basa en las tradiciones del pasado.

Annie Moore, uma adolescente Irlandesa, foi a primeira imigrante registrada na nova estação de recepção americana. Ela e seus dois irmãos mais novos, Anthony e Philip, tinham navegado por 12 dias no navio a vapor Nevada para se unirem a seus pais, que haviam chegado aos Estados Unidos anteriormente. 

Nos 62 anos seguintes, 12 milhões de pessoas entraram nesse país promissor através daquele local. Estima-se que cerca de 40 por cento dos cidadãos americanos de hoje podem ligar sua origem a alguém que ficou na fila daquele tão conhecido ponto de entrada para uma nova vida. 

Aquele porto de entrada não mais registra novos imigrantes; seu principal edifício tornou-se num museu a imigração. Seus visitantes podem pesquisar milhões de registros de entrada para saber sobre a história de sua família. Mas a história real está por trás dos nomes, datas e locais de nascimento, ela se encontra em suas vida — nas marcas que definiram o seu curso, nas esperanças e expectativas, alegrias, tristezas, decepções e sua pura determinação. 

Ao aprendermos suas a história, nos preparamos para prosseguir em direção a uma nova era. De uma maneira profunda, a história amplia a experiência da vida diária. A história, da jovem Annie Moore, é a nossa história. O vencedor do Prêmio Pulitzer — o autor David McCullough, um querido amigo do Coro do Tabernáculo Mórmon, disse: “A história oferece, de maneira única, um senso de proporção sobre a vida, nos dá uma percepção do nosso breve tempo na Terra e o quanto ele é valioso.”

As histórias daqueles que viveram antes de nós registradas em livros ou pequenas anotações, formam a base de nossa vida. O que quer que realizemos hoje fazemos sobre as grandes tradições do passado.

Annie Moore, a teenager from County Cork, Ireland, was the first immigrant registered at America’s new reception station. She and her two younger brothers, Anthony and Phillip, had sailed in steerage class for 12 days on the steamship Nevada to join their parents, who had arrived in the United States previously. 

Over the next 62 years, 12 million people poured into this country of promise through Ellis Island. It is estimated that nearly 40 percent of American citizens today can trace their ancestry to someone who stood in line at that much-heralded entry point to a new life. 

Ellis Island no longer registers new immigrants; its main building now houses an immigration museum. Visitors to the facility can search millions of arrival records to learn about their family history. But the real history lies behind the names, dates, and birthplaces, in the actual unfolding of peoples’ lives—the markers that set their course, their hopes and expectations, their joys, sorrows, disappointments, and sheer determination. 

As we learn their stories, we are better prepared to push forward to a new era. In a profound way, history enlarges the experience of daily living. In the stories of people like young Annie Moore, we see ourselves. Pulitzer Prize–winning author David McCullough, a dear friend of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, said it this way: “History encourages, as nothing else does, a sense of proportion about life, gives us a sense of the relative scale of our own brief time on earth and how valuable that is.” 

The stories of those who went before us, whether on the front page or in the footnotes, form the bedrock our lives. Whatever we may accomplish today, we build on great traditions of the past.

Aunque tuvieron lugar hace más de un siglo y medio, nos sirven de inspiración en la actualidad. Tal es el caso de James y Sarah Ferguson McDonald.

Esos inmigrantes irlandeses soñaban con forjar una vida mejor para su familia en el Oeste norteamericano, y en la primavera de 1850, comenzaron a cruzar las vastas llanuras como miembros de una numerosa caravana de pioneros con sueños similares.

Poco tiempo había transcurrido cuando la tragedia golpeó a la familia. James contrajo cólera y murió en menos de 24 horas, tras lo cual fue enterrado a orillas del río Platte. Esa misma noche, Sarah puso a sus niños a dormir y después, con un corazón apesadumbrado y pies cansados, fue hasta el río para quitarse la tierra que cubría sus piernas tras tan terrible jornada. Al poner los pies en las frías aguas, Sarah sintió “la fuerte corriente del río, y en medio del profundo pesar, imaginó cuán fácil sería dejarse arrastrar por el agua”, para así unirse a su amado esposo. Pero en ese preciso instante la llamó uno de sus hijos pequeños, y supo que debía seguir adelante por ellos. Secó sus pies, volvió a calzarse y regresó a la carreta.

Al día siguiente, Sarah se detuvo por última vez junto a la tumba de su esposo, y mirando hacia el oeste, ella y sus hijos siguieron adelante.

Sarah finalmente se estableció con su familia en las montañas rocosas. Allí vivió una vida larga y productiva, y su posteridad, que ahora llega a miles de seres, está agradecida por la fe, la esperanza y la perseverancia de su abuela pionera.

El valiente ejemplo de Sarah Ferguson McDonald y de muchos otros como ella nos inspira a todos, especialmente cuando sentimos pesar, los pies están cansados y nos enfrentamos a un futuro incierto. Entonces, al recordar esos ejemplos inspiradores del pasado, sencillamente seguimos adelante.

Though they took place over a century and a half ago, they can serve as an inspiration to us today. Such is the case with the story of James and Sarah Ferguson McDonald.

James and Sarah were Irish immigrants with dreams of making a new home and building a better life for their family in the American West. In the spring of 1850, they started across the vast American plains as members of a large wagon train of pioneers with similar dreams.

Tragedy struck the family soon after they began. James contracted the dreaded disease cholera and died within 24 hours. He was buried in the trackless prairie on the banks of the Platte River. That evening, Sarah settled the children into their beds and then, with an aching heart and tired feet, went down to the river to wash off the dust of a terrible day. As she put her bare feet into the cool water, Sarah felt “the strong current of the river, and the thought came to her, in her grief, of how easy it would be to slide into the water,” sink into the depths, and join her dear husband in death.  But just then one of her young children called out to her, and she knew she had to carry on for them. She dried her feet, put on her shoes, and went back to the wagon. 

The next day, Sarah paused one last time at the grave of her husband. Then, looking west, she and her children walked on.

Sarah eventually established her family in the Rocky Mountains. She lived a long and productive life, and her posterity—which now number in the thousands—are grateful for the faith, hope, and perseverance of their pioneer grandmother.

The courageous example of Sarah Ferguson McDonald and many, many others like her inspires us all, especially when our hearts ache, our feet are tired, or we face a fearful future. Even then, we can remember inspiring examples from the past and walk on.

The parents and children threw their hearts into the project, carefully selecting the wood, the shingles, and all the supplies. Great pride and satisfaction swelled in their hearts as it took shape. When friends came to play, the children would proudly show them how the playhouse was coming along. And the first thing they said to Dad when he came home from work was, “When can we work on our playhouse?” 

But when the playhouse was finished, the parents noticed that the children rarely played in it. They discovered “that having the house wasn’t really what motivated them. It was the building of it, and how they felt about their own contribution, that they found satisfying.”1 Turns out it was the process that was important, not the finished product. 

You’ve probably experienced this yourself. It’s a common phenomenon: A championship team rejoices when they raise the trophy, but they also cherish the smaller victories and defeats throughout the season. Parents feel proud on their son’s wedding day, but the memories that persist are of the smaller, simpler moments of his childhood. A college graduate is grateful for the diploma she receives, but what she’ll long remember are the long nights studying for finals, the professors who inspired her, and the excitement she felt every time she learned something new. It seems that getting there is indeed half the fun—and almost all of the memories.

So instead of waiting only for something to end, try to enjoy the moments along the way. Though there may be difficulties and wearisome effort, don’t be so eager for the destination that you miss the simple joys of the journey. Remember what the family learned from their playhouse—real growth and bonding and learning come in all of life’s ages and stages, not just at the end.

He was known for the unusually respectful attitude he showed toward the young people in his classroom. Even when they seemed a little unruly, he would treat them well. “Who knows?” he would say. “There may be among my pupils a great poet, a great preacher, a great philosopher!” Although it was the Germanic custom of the day for professors to keep their hats on when entering the schoolroom, John Trebonius always removed his, explaining, “I do not know but that there sits among [these students] one who will change the destiny of mankind. I take off my hat in deference to what they may become.” 

Sitting in that classroom, under the influence of that wise and gentle man, was a young Martin Luther, whose courage and convictions did indeed change the world.

People like John Trebonius who treat people according to their potential—who they can become rather than who they currently seem to be—can have a powerful influence on others. Their positive expectations inspire us to reach a little higher, do a little more, and become all that we can be. 

Truly, we are surrounded by greatness—or, at least, potential greatness. Given time, people can, and often do, surprise us. The neighborhood boy who made mischief may turn into a great teacher, inventor, or civic leader. The little girl next door may become a noted scientist, artist, or journalist. And both have the potential to become exceptional adults, parents, and neighbors. Life is a long walk on a long road, and we never know what the future may bring for those within our influence. But we do know that human potential is limitless.

So remember the story of John Trebonius from long ago, and take off your hat in respect for what the future may bring.

Episode 4426. Aired July 13, 2013*NewVideo*Todos necesitamos amor - Palabras de Inspiración**2ANwfxQcniM**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2ANwfxQcniM/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Todos sabemos que el alimento, el agua y el albergue son esenciales para nuestro sostén. Pero hay otra necesidad básica que a menudo pasamos por alto —la de amar y ser amados. El tacto tierno; las palabras, sonrisas y miradas dulces, todo nutre el alma como ninguna otra cosa lo hace. Más allá de nuestra edad, todos necesitamos amor.

Recientemente, un hombre advirtió que su perro otrora lleno de energía, había envejecido y se veía cansado. El mismo animal que corría a sus brazos al llegar a casa, ahora apenas podía levantar las orejas cuando lo oía acercarse. Si bien un día seguía a su amo ansiosamente por todos lados, ahora pasaba días enteros, aletargado. Ni siquiera ya corría a comer de su plato como solía hacerlo varias veces al día.

De hecho, el único momento en que parecía tener suficientes fuerzas para levantar su cuerpo cansado y dolorido era cuando su amo acariciaba al gato. Entonces el perro se incorporaba lentamente, se acercaba y se volcaba contra la pierna del hombre hasta que lo acariciara también a él. Cuando lo hacía, el animal meneaba la cola, satisfecho. Las necesidades físicas del viejo perro habían disminuido, pero su necesidad de amor era más fuerte que nunca. Pese a ser anciano —tal vez por ser anciano— aún necesitaba ser amado.

Los seres humanos somos muy parecidos; nunca dejamos de necesitar ser amados. Una mujer con mucha experiencia en el cuidado de gente anciana, observó que aquellos que viven solos no tienen la oportunidad de recibir la calidez del tacto humano, así que ella les sostiene las manos, les abraza y les palmotea la espalda cuando está con ellos, y ve cuánto esas personas valoran esos pequeños actos de afecto.

¿Acaso, no los valoramos todos? ¿Y no necesitamos el mismo aliento emocional que surge de expresar amor? El amar a los demás es la esencia de la buena vida, porque “Dios es amor; y el que permanece en amor, permanece en Dios”.

Episodio 4428. Transmitido el 27 de julio de 2014.*NewVideo*We All Need Love - The Spoken Word**oqujcC-t_78**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oqujcC-t_78/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**We all know that food, water, and shelter are essential to sustain life. But there’s another basic need that is too often overlooked—the need to love and be loved. Gentle touches, soft words, sweet smiles, and adoring looks nurture our soul in a way that nothing else can. No matter how old or young, we all need love. 

Recently, a man noticed that his once-energetic dog had become old and tired. The same dog who used to bound into his arms when he walked through the door now barely lifted an ear when she heard him coming. Where she once followed her master eagerly wherever he went, now she rested on her bed most of the day, every day. She didn’t even run to her food dish at mealtimes like she used to. 

In fact, it seemed that the only time she had energy enough to lift her tired, achy body was when she saw her master petting the cat. When that happened, the dog would slowly rise from her bed, gently amble over, and press her body against the man’s leg until he petted her too. As soon as he did, she contentedly wagged her tail. The dog’s needs for food and exercise had diminished, but her need for love was as strong as ever. Even though she was old—perhaps especially because she was old—she still needed to be loved.

People are much the same. We never outgrow the need to be loved. A woman with a lot of experience caring for the elderly observed that often, older people who live alone do not have occasion to feel the warmth of a human touch. So the woman made it a point to hold their hands, hug them, or pat their backs when she was with them. She noticed how much they appreciated even these small acts of affection. 

Don’t we all? And don’t we need, just as much, the emotional uplift that comes from expressing love? Loving others is the essence of living a good life. For “God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God” (1 John 4:16).

Those who are grateful tend to be happier, and those who are happy tend to be more grateful. Happiness and gratitude simply go together. Scholars and scientists, poets and philosophers have connected them for generations. 

We tend to think of gratitude primarily as a byproduct of happiness—when life is good and things are going our way, we feel thankful. But this is only half of the truth. Those who choose to be grateful even during hard times discover that gratitude creates happiness. Gratitude to God for everything around us awakens wonder and awe; it stimulates kindness and affection; it deepens humility and creates space in the heart for love and warmth. Gratitude is not just a reaction to our quality of life—it is how we determine our quality of life. Indeed, happiness inspires gratitude, but gratitude also inspires happiness. 

The words of British writer G. K. Chesterton remind us how we can practice gratitude all the time: 

You say grace before meals. 

All right. 

But I say grace before the play and the opera, 

And grace before the concert and pantomime, 

And grace before I open a book, 

And grace before sketching, painting, 

Swimming, fencing, boxing, walking, playing, dancing; 

And grace before I dip the pen in the ink.

True gratitude is a way of life, a perception and perspective that can change our lives for the better. And like any habit or skill, an attitude of gratitude just needs to be deliberately developed so that happiness can take root and flourish. 

Rabbi Harold Kushner, another noted writer, suggested that gratitude requires focus and concentration. He said, “Can you see the holiness in those things you take for granted—a paved road or a washing machine? If you concentrate on finding what is good in every situation, you will discover that your life will suddenly be 
filled with gratitude, a feeling that nurtures the soul.”

He asked the Lord three times to take it from him, but it remained. Yet Paul came to see divine purpose in his infirmities and hardships, declaring with great wisdom, “For when I am weak, then am I strong.” 

At times, for each of us, the path of life seems to be all uphill, filled with obstacles and hazards. But these struggles are not meant to stop us or discourage us. They are meant to change us. If we face our challenges with all of the courage, patience, and faith we have—undoubtedly developing a great deal more in the process—we’ll reach the top of that hill and make an important discovery: In the journey of life, the destination is not as important as what we become along the way. 

From that elevated perspective, we may notice that our hardships were the very things we needed to make us better and stronger. Becoming our best self often happens because of—rather than in spite of—unfavorable circumstances. Our greatest trials can become our greatest teachers.

It was this truth that inspired an unknown author to pen these words: 
I asked God for strength that I might achieve. 
I was made weak that I might learn humbly to obey. 
I asked for health that I might do greater things. 
I was given infirmity that I might do better things. 
I asked for riches that I might be happy. 
I was given poverty that I might be wise. 
I asked for power that I might have the praise of men. 
I was given weakness that I might feel the need of God. 
I asked for all things that I might enjoy life. 
I was given life that I might enjoy all things. 
I got nothing that I asked for but everything I needed. 
Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered. 
I am … most richly blessed.

He says that it is quite natural to feel shy, to be uncomfortable in a room of strangers. His advice? “Turn it the other way around and think, ‘I’m walking into a room full of very shy people, and my job is to make them feel at ease and comfortable in their situation.’ That is really the root of good manners: making the people around you feel comfortable.”1 

Some people are so skilled at making others feel comfortable. They’re genuinely interested in others; they’re kind and thoughtful; they’re easy to be around. Instead of focusing on themselves, they choose to be considerate and responsive, and they seem to take sincere joy in making people happy. 

It’s easy to assume that some people are just naturally outgoing—that it comes easily to them—and the rest of us simply aren’t that way. But the fact is that with a little effort and practice, anyone can choose to be open, loving, and warm. That might mean we attentively listen, or we think, “What can I learn from this person?” For others, it might mean we speak up a little more or make the effort to meet someone new. 

No matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, you can learn to put others at ease. A young woman who left friends and family to attend college discovered this simple truth. When she began to extend herself, she found that more often than not, people welcomed her outreach. They, too, wanted a friend. They began to feel comfortable around her, and she made new friends wherever she went. She found that by making simple introductions and finding out about others, she could help people relax in her company and enjoy being around her. 

The skill of good manners is not beyond anyone’s reach—at its roots, it’s simply a matter of forgetting ourselves and helping others feel comfortable.

With it came a small French fur-trading post, St. Louis. The next year, the Lewis and Clark expedition set out from that Mississippi River settlement for the Pacific Ocean, and a tradition was born. St. Louis became the gateway to the West, not just for intrepid explorers, trappers, and miners but for scores of wagon trains and steamships carrying hopeful settlers to a new beginning.
 
These were pioneers in every sense of the word, establishing vibrant communities despite isolation, starvation, disease, disappointment, and the harshness of the very land they hoped to settle. Year after year they set out from St. Louis in courageous pursuit of new frontiers. But as the decades passed and the railroad took over transport, St. Louis became just another stop on the way to somewhere that already had a name and a populace.
 
In an effort to revive St. Louis's Legacy, civic leaders invited architects to submit designs for a Jefferson National Expansion Memorial to be built in the city. It is fitting that a Finnish immigrant, Eero Saarinen, was selected to design the monument to the people who left the comforts of home in search of the American dream.
 
He proposed a ribbon of gleaming stainless steel, arching 630 feet high and 630 feet wide. Like the westward movement it memorializes, the arch tested the ingenuity of its builders. It can withstand winds up to 150 miles an hour, is flexible enough to sway 18 inches in the wind, and commands a view from the top for 30 miles.¹
 
Today the Gateway Arch is one of the most famous landmarks in the world, a reminder to strive for new frontiers with that same indomitable spirit of those who by sheer grit and resolve helped build a nation "from sea to shining sea."²

For the most part, our associations are pleasant and cause little or no distress, but every now and then the actions of others can offend or even hurt us. 

 It seems to be a natural part of the human experience that we will, on occasion, be offended by someone. Criticism from a family member, a misunderstanding at work, or the unkind behavior of a neighbor—any of these can cause offense. It's basically unavoidable: at some time, the behavior of another person will run counter to what we hoped would happen, and our feelings are hurt. When these painful moments occur, we have a choice to make. We can either choose to harbor feelings of resentment, or we can choose to deal with the offense in a constructive way and let go of the negative feelings. 

 It's normal to become angry or frustrated with others, but hanging on to those feelings or even letting them grow and fester is not necessary. Though we may be the victim of someone else's thoughtlessness, we are victimized a second time when we choose to hold on to our hurt feelings. Even if we can't escape being offended, we can at least avoid the destructive results.

 It is far better to make the choice to recognize the suffering caused by bad feelings and then put an end to them—to find a way, with kindness and compassion for yourself and for the offending party, to resolve the matter positively. As we apply the truth in the Proverb "A soft answer turneth away wrath,"  we can eventually achieve what the Psalmist promised: "Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them."  The initial pain of offense may be inevitable, but the ongoing suffering is optional, if we choose not to be offended.

Generalmente, nuestras interacciones son agradables y no producen mayor estrés, pero de vez en cuando, la actitud de los demás puede llegar a ofendernos o mortificarnos.

Parece ser un componente natural de la experiencia humana el que a veces alguien nos ofenda. La crítica de un familiar, un malentendido en el trabajo o la actitud antipática de un vecino, son todas cosas que pueden ofendernos. Resulta casi inevitable que en algún momento, la conducta de otra persona se contraponga a lo que uno hubiera preferido y nos sintamos heridos. Cuando esas cosas ocurren, tenemos dos opciones: podemos anidar sentimientos de resentimiento, o encarar la ofensa de un modo constructivo y hacer a un lado los sentimientos negativos.

Es normal sentir enojo o frustración hacia otra persona, pero conservar esos sentimientos y dejarlos crecer y fermentar es innecesario. Aunque seamos víctimas de un acto desconsiderado, podemos llegar a perjudicarnos aún más si decidimos retener el rencor. Aunque no podamos escapar a la ofensa, bien podemos evitar los resultados destructivos.

Es mucho mejor reconocer el sufrimiento causado por malos sentimientos y poner fin a ellos —hallar un modo de resolver el asunto de una manera positiva, con bondad y compasión hacia uno mismo y para con el agresor. Al aplicar la verdad que hallamos en el proverbio que dice: "La blanda respuesta quita la ira", podremos lograr la promesa del salmista: "Mucha paz tienen los que aman tu ley, y no hay para ellos tropiezo", o sea, que nada los ofenderá. El dolor inicial de la ofensa tal vez sea inevitable, pero sí podemos evitar el sufrimiento prolongado  si decidimos no sentirnos ofendidos.

They give us a chance to mark our progress, celebrate for a moment our accomplishments and growth, and renew our bonds as a family, community, and nation. And so today we celebrate this land that we love. 

As we do, we recognize that although we have much to celebrate, things are not perfect. Even as patriotic parades and picnics unfold and as dazzling fireworks burst in the air, we know that there are problems at home and abroad. But those troubles and challenges should not damper our fervent love of country, nor should they discourage our desire to do our part to make this nation better. Just as there have always been difficulties, things can always get better—as long as courageous people reach out to one another in love.

In 1968, Gerald Ford, then a member of the House of Representatives, saw true patriotism as the solution to the difficulties facing the nation. He said: "America now is stumbling through the darkness of hatred and divisiveness. Our values, our principles, and our determination to succeed as a free and democratic people will give us a torch to light the way. And we will survive and become the stronger—not only because of a patriotism that stands for love of country, but a patriotism that stands for love of people."1

Indeed, true patriotism is more than love of country—it is love of people. That is the torch that lights the way to our best future. Think of fireworks as celebrations of individual lives, past and present—each unique and magnificent. Think of parades and picnics as gatherings of love for the people who have made us who we are. We will survive and thrive as a nation as we love our country and as we love one another.

But let's not forget, most fathers give their all for their families. 

Most do their best to be there for their kids, to set good examples and show their children how to be responsible adults. Most fathers try to teach their children goodness and truth. They provide for, protect, and love their families—and then love them some more.

Just as no child is perfect, no father is perfect. We all hope to be remembered more for our strengths than our shortcomings. As days become years and fathers grow older, we might consider showing more compassion, forgiveness, and appreciation. Choose to remember the good moments, the happy times. Hold on to the memories that can sustain us in loss or heartache and can give us hope as we struggle to leave our own legacy of love.

A middle-aged woman recently experienced the loss of her father. In most ways, he was a very ordinary man. His professional pursuits were varied and not necessarily noteworthy. He lived a simple life, but he provided for his family and stayed true to his wife and children until the end. Upon his passing, his daughter reflected on his life and realized that his greatest gift to her was a feeling of pure love, and she was only now beginning to understand what a precious gift that was. 

When she was a girl, he sang her to sleep. When she was a teenager, he told her she was beautiful, and she believed him. As a grown woman, she still wanted to please him, and whenever he smiled at her, she couldn't help but smile back. She knew that he loved her, and quite frankly, she did not need to know much else.

Each dad is unique; each has his own way of expressing love. But love is what all good fathers—all true fathers—have in common, and love is what will live on in the hearts of their children forever.

She said, "My health is not the best, but it could be worse. My money situation is not the best, but it could be worse. My life right now may not be the best, but it could be worse." Her words revealed none of the despair nor the pride of comparing herself to others but the happiness and peace that comes of perspective, of remembering that things can always get better—and in the meantime, faith and hope can carry us through. 

Most of us could say the same thing, no matter our age: our life may not be the best, but it could be worse. That understanding can keep us from overreacting not only to our challenges but also to our successes. It will help smooth out the rocky stretches of life and help us appreciate the smooth spots. The more we experience of life, the more we realize that, eventually, good things usually come to good people who stay the course and do their best. 

When a mother hears her grown children share their worries and anxieties about their own children, she wisely says, "It could be worse." When a husband and wife talk of tight finances or stressful jobs, they remind themselves, "It could be worse." And when a busy high schooler frets about grades and friends and too much to do, it may be helpful to think, "It could be worse." There may be a rare occasion when things really are as bad as they could possibly be, but that's unusual. Given time and effort, very often things get better. Until then, understanding that life is relatively good and blessings are all around us will enlarge our perspective and increase our peace of mind. 

So in the coming days and when life seems especially hard, it may be helpful to remember: things may not be the best, but they could be worse. 

Episode 4418. Aired May 18, 2014*NewVideo*An Eternal Perspective - The Spoken Word**BcbthTORc9Q**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BcbthTORc9Q/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Our common lot is to be born into an imperfect world, filled with disappointment and unanswered questions. It is natural, in these circumstances, to worry about the future. We wonder if things will work out for us-and for our loved ones.

Too often we try to make sense of life based on a very narrow perspective, which is somewhat like trying to understand the plot of a novel after reading only one page. A perspective that is limited to what we can see, feel, touch, and explain right now will leave us unsatisfied and longing for something more, something deeper. A larger, more expansive, even eternal perspective teaches us that good can come of bad, strength can be borne of weakness, and joy can come on the other side of sorrow.

We are all called upon to overcome obstacles of various kinds. This is necessary in order to fulfill our life's purpose. Each challenge we face here can prepare us for something much greater hereafter. This life is a laboratory for eternity: we learn and grow; in time, we become better, wiser, more understanding. Distressing questions are ultimately answered, life's injustices are eventually resolved, and what seems impossible becomes reality.

So try to accentuate the positive, and hold on to the assurance of good things to come. We simply cannot cower in fear or let go of hope.

Many centuries ago, an Irish poet penned inspired lines of hope that have since been set to music and sung through many generations. The lyrics of "Be Thou My Vision" speak of confidence in the present and faith in the future, the kind of eternal perspective that will bring us safely home:

Great God of heaven,My victory won,May I reach heaven's joys, Bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart,Whatever befall,Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

Their salute reflects the kind of knowledge that can come only from experience, the humble pride born of defending the cause of liberty. To them, that flag represents freedom and duty, love of country, the fellowship and sacrifice of companions in a worthy cause, and a sure awareness of what makes this country great. 

It is good to pause and remember, however, that too many of their companions did not survive long enough to be veterans. Theirs was the ultimate sacrifice. And it is well to set aside a day in their honor, to reflect on the cost of the freedoms we enjoy, to remember those who have sacrificed for our safety and well-being. If we truly remember and honor them, then the price they paid shall not have been in vain. 

It is also well to consider, on our day of remembrance, the sacrifices of the loved ones of these heroes—the parents and spouses, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters who tearfully but proudly bid farewell to their soldiers, never again to see them in this life.

As Richard L. Evans observed decades ago on this broadcast: "Those who have been deprived of the association of their loved ones, need no day of special reminder. For them every day brings its own reminder. And to you for whom Memorial Day is a day of deep personal loss and of fresh sorrow: may He who gave us life give also to your troubled hearts His assurance of the reality that life is eternal, and that there is no one from whom we have parted here whom we may not know and cherish and live with yet again."1

De ese pesar colectivo surge un sentimiento de unidad entre aquellos que padecen, el cual se apodera del corazón, mas es muy difícil expresar verbalmente.

En nuestros esfuerzos por dar ánimo a quienes sufren, nuestras palabras de consuelo, aunque sinceras, tal vez no lleguen a llenar el vacío. Sin embargo, un abrazo cálido, mitigará todo sentimiento de soledad. El sólo saber que alguien entiende pues se ha sentido así alguna vez, es suficiente para empezar a sanar, para sobreponerse al dolor y hallar algo de consuelo y de paz.

Una destacada facultativa y autora escribió sobre el caso de una niña, Louisa, que se sintió devastada cuando su gatito murió en un accidente. Sus padres y hermanos mayores hicieron todo lo posible por consolarla, pero sólo su abuela, cuyo esposo también había fallecido, logró ayudarla a sentirse mejor. Ella sabía que Louisa no necesitaba una explicación tanto como un tierno abrazo. La niña lloró en el hombro de su abuela y al cabo de unos minutos, al mirar hacia arriba, vio que ella también estaba llorando, y eso fue suficiente.


La pequeña Louisa tal vez no podía describir en palabras cómo se sentía, pero ese momento de tierna compenetración con su abuela la ayudó a mitigar el dolor. No fue lo que hablaron lo que llenó el vacío del corazón de la niña, sino el comprender que, de algún modo, su abuela la entendía, y sin decir nada, le brindó comprensión, amor y consuelo.

Claro está que ningún grado de compasión puede devolvernos a quienes se han marchado, pero sí puede, en cierta medida, "silenciar el conflicto, la soledad y el sufrimiento". Aunque no podemos explicarlo ni negarlo, la compasión puede "llenar vacíos profundos" y hacer que "las voces extinguidas por la muerte, se enciendan en cantos de esperanza sempiterna".

And the loss we feel most deeply is the loss of loved ones whom we miss so much. Out of this collective mourning comes a shared understanding—the unity of those who sorrow that transcends words but cannot escape our hearts.

In our efforts to console those who suffer loss, our words of comfort, though earnest, may not always fill the gap in their heart. Our warm embrace, however, can help them feel less alone. Often just knowing that someone understands—that someone has felt what they feel—is enough to help them begin to heal—to push through the pain and find some comfort and peace.

Noted physician and author Rachel Naomi Remen tells of a little girl, Louisa, who was devastated when her pet kitten was killed in an accident. The adults in her family used their best grownup wisdom to comfort her, but only her grandmother, whose husband had also passed away, truly helped her feel better. She knew that Louisa did not need an explanation so much as she needed to be held close. Louisa sobbed on her shoulder, and when she finally looked up, she saw that her grandmother was crying along with her. That was enough.1

Young Louisa may not have had the ability to describe in words how she felt. But what happened between Louisa and her grandmother went beyond words. It wasn't what was said that filled the emptiness in Louisa's heart. It was the realization that, somehow, her grandmother understood. In her silence she conveyed empathy, love, and reassurance. 

Of course, no amount of compassion can bring back our loved ones. But we can, to a degree, "still the strife, the loneliness and grief." In ways we can neither explain nor deny, compassion can "heal the piercing silence of passing" and summon those "sweet familiar strains, the voices lost in death, arise in songs of hope everlasting."

El autor y líder religioso Neal A. Maxwell era un hombre compasivo aunque muy ocupado. De una pared de su oficina colgaba un útil recordatorio de la realidad del diario vivir: "Mis brazos no pueden hacer por tantas personas todo cuanto mi corazón quisiera". Ésta no es tanto una excusa para hacer a un lado las necesidades de los demás, sino un reconocimiento de que con cautela y sabiduría es mucho lo que sí podemos hacer.

No logramos demasiado cuando intentamos correr más rápido de lo que las fuerzas nos lo permiten o de hacer más de lo prudente. No nos agobiemos con demandas ajenas y hagamos lo que podamos. No dejemos que nos abrumen los muchos deberes, hagamos lo que está a nuestro alcance. No lamentemos no poder hacer más por más personas, hagamos lo que se pueda hacer.

Todo se resume a "¿Qué es lo que puedo hacer?". Eso es algo que cada uno debe responder individualmente, según sus circunstancias, las cuales no sólo varían entre una y otra persona, sino que van cambiando con el tiempo. En ciertas etapas de la vida tal vez podamos dar más de nuestros medios,  tiempo y esfuerzos. En otras tal vez sólo podamos ofrecer cosas más sencillas, como una oración, una llamada, una sonrisa  o una expresión de bondad. Si damos lo que podemos, sentiremos la paz que proviene de saber que nuestra ofrenda fue auténtica.

El mismo principio se aplica a nuestra salud y felicidad, a nuestras metas, obligaciones, expectativas y relaciones. Si hacemos de corazón lo que podemos, poco a poco, nuestros sinceros esfuerzos y nuestras genuinas contribuciones, aunque no parezcan ser demasiado, marcarán una gran diferencia.

Noted author and religious leader Neal A. Maxwell was a very compassionate but busy man. He had on his office wall a useful reminder of this reality of life by Anne Morrow Lindbergh: "My life cannot implement in action the demands of all the people to whom my heart responds."1 That's not so much an excuse to ignore the needs of others as it is a perceptive statement about pace and wisely doing what we can.2

We serve no one well when we try to run faster than we have strength or do more than is wise. We can't do all things or be all things to all people. If we feel burdened by the demands of others, we just do what we can. If we feel overwhelmed by responsibilities and duties, we just do what we can. If we regret that we can't do more for more people, we just do what we can.

The question comes down to "What can I do?" And that is best answered by each person individually, according to our situation and circumstances. Not only is it different for every person, but it also changes over time. During certain seasons of life, perhaps we can do more-giving of our means, our unhurried time, our resources. At others, perhaps our offering is more simple-a prayer, a phone call, a smile, a kind word. If we genuinely offer what we can, we will be comforted with the joy and peace that come from knowing our offering was authentic and sincere.

The same principle applies to our health and happiness, our well-being and goals, our obligations, expectations, and relationships. If we just sincerely do what we can, then little by little, our honest efforts, our wholehearted contribution-even if it doesn't seem like much-can make all the difference.

Los marineros podían ver el faro, pero debían hallar el paso entre las traicioneras rocas que rodeaban la bahía. Normalmente había una luz en la costa alineada con el faro que indicaba por dónde navegar para atracar en forma segura, pero esa noche, las luces bajas se habían apagado.

Finalmente, el desesperado capitán sintió que no tenían otra opción sino entrar en la bahía sin la guía de las luces bajas. "Con mano firme y un corazón valiente" —aunque casi en total oscuridad— "el viejo marino hizo girar el timón". Trágicamente, erró en su trayectoria, el barco se estrelló contra las rocas y la tripulación pereció.

El predicador explicó entonces la lección a aprender de esa historia: El Maestro cuidará el faro, pero depende de nosotros para mantener las luces bajas encendidas. Philip Paul Bliss dirigía el canto en aquella reunión y se sintió tan inspirado por el relato del predicador que escribió lo que llegaría a ser uno de sus himnos más conocidos, "Brillan rayos de clemencia". Él también compuso la música de un himno que lleva como título, "Luces bajas", publicado en el año 1871.
Las tormentas de la vida ponen a muchos en peligro. Tal vez anhelen ver brillar los "rayos de clemencia" pero no están seguros de cómo sortear los obstáculos en el trayecto. Sabemos cómo se sienten pues en alguna que otra ocasión, todos hemos estado a la deriva.

Muy a menudo, Dios nos usa a nosotros para rescatarlos. Si podemos mantener la luz de la fe brillando en el corazón, si alineamos nuestra luz con la de los cielos, podremos guiar al exhausto marinero a puerto seguro. Seamos esas luces bajas que reflejen destellos por las olas de la mar, y "al errante marinero ayudemos a salvar".

The mariners on board could see the lighthouse, but they needed to find their way through the narrow passage in the treacherous rocks that surrounded the harbor. Normally a light on the shore, aligned with the lighthouse, marked the passage to safety. But on this night, the lower lights had gone out.

Finally, the desperate captain decided they had no choice but to proceed into the harbor without the guidance of the lower lights. "With a strong hand and brave heart"—but in almost total darkness—"the old pilot turned the wheel." Tragically, he missed the channel, crashed the boat upon the rocks, and lost the lives of his sailors.1

Moody then explained the lesson to be learned from his story: the Master will take care of the great lighthouse, but He depends on us to keep the lower lights burning. Philip Paul Bliss was directing the singing at the meeting that night and was so inspired by Moody's story that he wrote what would become one of his most popular hymns, "Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy." He also composed the music, a hymn tune known as "Lower Lights," which was first published in 1871.

The storms of life put many around us in peril. They may long to approach the light of "our Father's mercy" but are unsure how to navigate the obstacles in their way. We all know how they feel, because each of us has been lost at sea from time to time.

Most often, God uses us to rescue them. If we can keep the light of faith burning in our hearts, if we align our light with the Light above, we can guide an exhausted mariner safely home. We can be the lower lights that "send a gleam across the wave. Some poor fainting, struggling seaman [we] may rescue, [we] may save."2

And the older we get, the more stories we have. Truly, our "seasoned citizens" are treasure chests of experience and wisdom—and with each passing year, they become more valuable. But do we value and cherish their knowledge? Do we take the time to get to know them?
In the rush of today's busy world, seniors often get overlooked. Yet each one has a fascinating backstory. Each one has weathered life's storms and taken journeys the younger generation is just now beginning. They pursued their dreams, they fell in love, they raised families, and they built the towns we live in. 
As life becomes more and more complex and challenging for the rising generation, it would be wise to seek counsel from members of previous generations. We'll likely find that the problems they faced—and overcame—really aren't that different from what we face today. 
One man made a point of taking his son to visit a grandfather whose health was failing but whose mind was sharp. He thought it would help the elderly man to have a young visitor. But the person who most benefited was the boy. His grandfather loved him openly and genuinely, encouraged his ideas, and made him feel important. And the grandson came to realize that, inside, older people still feel like young people. He gained new respect for the years of experience his grandfather had and learned to appreciate his wisdom. 
How wise are those who are not yet old but who seek the company of our elderly citizens! There is scarcely a better source of practical knowledge, lived experience, or wise counsel. We simply need to look beyond the aged exterior and realize, as Charles Dickens observed, that "every wrinkle [is] but a notch in the quiet calendar of a well-spent life."1

But a community can also be a team, each citizen joining in common causes for the betterment of society. A workplace is a team, each worker contributing to the success of the company or organization. And then there's the ultimate "home team"—the family, with each member helping the others to achieve more than they could ever do alone. In all aspects of life, we need each other. We need people doing their best and giving their best for the benefit and progress of the whole.

Some may prefer to "go it alone"—to move independently through life and not rely on others. But that's impossible. We all eat food we didn't grow, we wear clothes we didn't sew, and we find it easier to reach our goals because of the efforts of a team. For example, an author may write a compelling book alone, but a team of people gets it published and on the shelf. A composer can create a masterpiece alone, but it often takes a team of performers to bring it to life. 

Not long ago, a series of canyon fires over the summer caused mudslides and flooding that ravaged a small town. One homeowner, who for many years had prized his fierce independence, was especially hard-hit. His yard was flooded, leaving a mess too massive and too expensive to take on alone. As he wondered how he would recover, a large team of neighbors and volunteers, without being asked, set to work to repair the damage. The man came to realize that he needed others—and others needed him. That's the value of teamwork: together everyone accomplishes more than they could ever do alone. 

Just as teamwork wins championships, teamwork also builds strength and character, teaches leadership and cooperation, and develops discipline and trust. Nothing builds closeness and camaraderie like joining together in a good cause."

The appropriately named Dead Sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water on earth. As a result, it cannot support life. Neither plants nor fish or other animals can receive any nourishment from its salty waters.
Approximately 100 miles to the north is another sea, the Sea of Galilee. Its fresh water has supported commercial fishing for over 2,000 years. Plants grow freely along its shoreline, and water is pumped from the Sea of Galilee to supply drinking water to nearby countries. 
The difference between these two neighboring seas is that the Dead Sea has no outlet. Water flows in from the Jordan River, but no water flows out; it keeps every drop. By contrast, for every drop of water that the Sea of Galilee receives, it gives away in equal measure. 
Long ago, author Bruce Barton, noting this difference, made the following observation: "The Sea of Galilee gives and lives. The other sea gives nothing. It is named the 'Dead Sea.' There are two [kinds of] seas. ... There are two kinds of people."1
Are we the kind of people who give—and live? Are other people strengthened, even enlivened, after spending time with us? Or do we drain the life out of others? If we find ourselves taking more than we're giving, there are simple ways to reverse that trend. We can start today by finding someone to encourage, to help, or to uplift. 
Especially at this Easter season, when we celebrate renewal and rebirth, when we rejoice in the promise of the abundant life offered by the Master who "went about doing good,"2 we might pause to remember that only in giving of ourselves do we truly live. The miracle of such giving is that the more we give to others, the more we have to give. If, however, we withhold compliments, praise, or good works, we feel depleted. So turn the tide in your favor, and give of yourself to others—one drop of kindness at a time.

In particular, several presidents of the United States have stood at the podium. The list includes Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George H. W. Bush. Records show that thousands—sometimes more than twice the normal capacity—crowded into the Tabernacle to hear them speak.   

Their messages varied, but often they spoke of the power and influence of the country—its potential for good and the duties that come with that potential. In doing so, they usually did not point to material wealth or military might as the source of the nation's power but rather to the goodness of its people.

John F. Kennedy spoke in the Tabernacle in 1963, just weeks before his assassination in Dallas. He spoke of far-reaching national and international initiatives. But he began his address by heralding the strengths of character that define the people of America. Said President Kennedy, "The qualities that we seek in America, the qualities which we like to feel this country has, [are] courage, patience, faith, self-reliance, perseverance, and, above all, an unflagging determination to see the right prevail."1 

Could these words, spoken decades ago, be used also to describe us—our neighbors, family, co-workers, and friends? When history reflects on our era, will it remember us as people with courage and an unflagging determination to see right prevail? Will it focus on our self-reliance and perseverance, our faith and patience? And will we be remembered for our good judgment, integrity, and dedication? 

A nation may be applauded for its successes and contributions to the world, but its true measure is found in the character of its people.

Compuesto en un estallido de inspiración en 23 días, fue el primero presentado como una ofrenda de Pascua en 1742 en Dublín, Irlanda. Desde entonces, ha sido disfrutado miles de veces en todo el mundo, llegando a ser una de las obras más populares jamás creadas en la historia de la música.

Pero casi no llega a acontecer. En 1741, a los 56 años de edad, Handel había sufrido una serie de fracasos musicales y perdido el patrocinio real. Desanimado, le dijo a su amigo y colaborador, Charles Jennens, que no planeaba componer ninguna otra obra ese año. Como lo observó un comentarista, "Los momentos de depresión y duda afectan aun a los célebres, y hasta los mismos genios pierden la visión del futuro".

Pero Jennens creyó poder persuadir a su amigo a volver a intentarlo. Había compilado un texto bíblico con la esperanza de que Handel aplicara "todo su genio en él". Afortunadamente para nosotros, y tal vez compelido por el tema, Handel empezó a escribir. Quizá sintió que podía identificarse con el varón de dolores, despreciado y desechado, y experimentado en quebrantos. Tal vez, como a todos nosotros, le llegó al corazón el mensaje del Mesías, que la gran luz de esperanza brilla para todo el que anda en tinieblas.

Para Handel, "El Mesías" pareció ser una nueva oportunidad y un nuevo comienzo. Aunque en sus 74 años de vida compuso muchas óperas, oratorios, cantatas y obras corales, su nombre estará por siempre vinculado a "El Mesías". Es destacable que cerca del fin de su vida, ciego y muy enfermo, Handel insistió en asistir a una presentación de "El Mesías" en el Covent Garden de Londres, el 6 de abril de 1759. Handel falleció sólo ocho días después, pero su música vivirá para siempre.

Composed in a burst of inspiration in only 23 days, it was first performed as an Easter offering in the spring of 1742 in Dublin, Ireland. Since then, it has been performed thousands of times in every corner of the world, becoming one of the most popular pieces of music ever created. 

But it almost didn't happen at all. In 1741, the 56-year-old Handel had just suffered through a series of musical failures and had lost his royal patronage. Discouraged, he told his friend and collaborator, Charles Jennens, that he didn't plan on doing any more composing that year. As one writer observed, "Even for prodigies moments of black depression and self-doubt arise, and ... even geniuses cannot see the future."1 

But Jennens believed he could persuade his friend to try again. He had compiled a scriptural text with the hope that Handel would apply "his whole Genius and Skill upon it."2 Fortunately for us, and perhaps compelled by the subject of the text, Handel set pen to paper. Maybe Handel felt he could identify with the Man of sorrows, despised and rejected, acquainted with grief.3 Perhaps he resonated personally—as we all do—with the message of Messiah: that the "great light" of hope shines for all who "walked in darkness."4 

For Handel, Messiah seemed to be a turning point of sorts, a new beginning, a fresh start. Although during his 74 years he composed many operas, oratorios, cantatas, and choral works, his name will forever be associated with Messiah. It is fitting, then, that near the end of his life, blind and in fragile health, Handel insisted on attending a performance of Messiah at Covent Garden on April 6, 1759.5 Handel died just eight days later, but his music will live forever.

Aired March 9, 2014*NewVideo*The Power of Positive Living - The Spoken Word**U0s3t-IMXac**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U0s3t-IMXac/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**"If you were arrested for kindness, would there be enough evidence to convict you?" commentator Michael Josephson once asked. He then noted something we have all experienced: "Some people cheer up a room by entering it, others by leaving it. What do you bring to your interactions with workmates, friends, and family? Is it encouragement, optimism, or kind words? Or is it pessimism, criticism, or cynicism?"1

As beautiful and abundant as this world is, there often seems to be a shortage of kindness and optimism. Many of us are doing our best to stay positive and look for the good, but sometimes we may feel weighed down by the gloominess and rudeness around us. Indeed, it can be difficult to be kindhearted in what seems to be, at times, a cold-hearted world. 

We need hope and strength, two of the great fundamental virtues that can shape our nature and our world. Even in the face of compelling evidence to the contrary, we can choose to believe that things will work out and that people, in their hearts, respond best to kindness. These are decisions of hope and strength; they are the power of positive living. 

It can be done; in fact, it can become a way of life. That's what has happened with an 84-year-old woman who lives in an assisted living center. It would be easy for her to complain about being left alone after the passing of her dear husband; it would be easy to grumble about her inability to walk and her lack of freedom; it would be easy to gripe about the food, the weather, her health, and her situation. But she has made a decision to be positive and to be kind. She has become the person who cheers up a room by entering it. As a result, people are drawn to her. They call and visit her for no reason at all. They just like being around her. 

That's the power of positive living: the more you look for all that is good and hopeful, the more you find yourself surrounded by it.

Criado como un príncipe en la corte de Faraón, Moisés creció en circunstancias muy propicias, siendo bien educado y, según las Escrituras, "poderoso en palabras y hechos".

Sin embargo, renunció a sus bienes y renombre y se transformó en un humilde siervo de Dios, dedicando sus fuerzas y destrezas, por el resto de su vida, a ayudar a los demás. Con el tiempo, fue descrito como "muy manso, más que todos los hombres... sobre la tierra".

A menudo pensamos en una persona mansa como alguien pasivo, sin firmeza, y tímido. Por cierto que eso no describe a Moisés, quien enfrentó a Faraón, liberó a los hebreos y partió las aguas del Mar Rojo. ¿Cómo es, entonces, que a un gran líder como él se le puede considerar tanto poderoso como manso?

Tal vez Moisés aprendió algo sobre la mansedumbre y el poder durante su memorable encuentro con Dios en la cima del monte. Quizá fue su comprensión de la verdadera fuente de poder lo que le permitió ser poderoso y al mismo tiempo manso.

Miles de años después, hay gran necesidad de mansedumbre en este mundo que premia la presunción y el autoelogio. Hay quienes la descartan  suponiendo que el éxito proviene de ser agresivo y competitivo. Pero ser manso no es ser débil. El manso se siente seguro de sí mismo pero al mismo tiempo es dócil. No tiene la necesidad de eclipsar a otras personas y no se irrita fácilmente. Su noble actitud le permite poner las necesidades de los demás sobre las propias.

De todas las virtudes esenciales en la vida, quizá la mansedumbre sea la más importante, pues sin ella no crecemos. Requiere una autoevaluación sincera y que reconozcamos nuestras imperfecciones y deseemos cambiar. La mansedumbre resulta de saber que cuanto hagamos bien proviene de Dios. Tal vez en eso se base esta declaración hecha por otro Ser conocido tanto por Su mansedumbre como por Su poder: "Bienaventurados los mansos, porque ellos recibirán la tierra como heredad."

Episódio 4412. Transmitido em 6 de abril de 2014.*NewVideo*Blessed Are the Meek - The Spoken Word**VAdaaeAm9iQ**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAdaaeAm9iQ/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**The prophet Moses is one of the great leaders in history. He is honored and revered in multiple faith traditions worldwide. Raised as a prince in Pharaoh's court, Moses grew up with every advantage. He was educated and powerful; as the scripture records, he "was mighty in words and in deeds."1 

And yet he forsook his wealth and worldly acclaim and became a humble servant of God, dedicating his strength and abilities—even the rest of his life—to helping others. In the end, he was described as "very meek, above all the men ... upon the face of the earth."2

We often think of a meek person as one who is passive, unassertive, even shy. Surely that does not describe Moses, who boldly stood before Pharaoh, liberated the Hebrews, and parted the Red Sea. So how is it that a great leader like Moses could be considered both mighty and meek?

Perhaps Moses learned something about meekness—and power—during his memorable encounter with God on the mountaintop. Perhaps it was his understanding of the true Source of power that enabled him to be powerful himself, and at the same time meek.

Thousands of years later, the need for meekness abounds in a world that prizes hard-hitting brashness and self-promotion. Some disregard meekness, thinking that success comes only from aggression and competitiveness. But meekness is not weakness. Meek people are secure in who they are and yet are teachable. They don't feel a need to overshadow others. They are not easily provoked. Their abundant attitude enables them to put the needs of others above their own. 

Of all the virtues vital for life, perhaps meekness is among the most essential, for without it there is no growth. It demands an honest evaluation of one's heart. It asks us to acknowledge our imperfections and be strong enough to make changes. Meekness comes of knowing that anything we do well is a gift from God. Perhaps therein lies the truth of this statement, made by another who was known for both His meekness and His power: "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."3

It seemed that hungry deer had been feeding on it throughout the winter, until nothing but a tangle of brown sticks remained. The tender plants appeared damaged beyond repair. Disappointed, the family determined they would need to pull the ivy out, replant, and start over. For the time being, they tried to forget about the assault to their ivy and saved the somber task for warmer weather.

When spring finally arrived, the family was shocked by what they saw: the broken vines had somehow mended, and tiny buds had appeared. In time, those little buds flourished into beautiful, green leaves. Today, several springs later, the ivy is robust and continues to spread its leafy sprouts around the home.

Though it seemed miraculous, the rebirth of the ivy was actually not that unusual. Similar miracles happen every year as spring follows winter in an unceasing and marvelous cycle of rejuvenation. It's an eternal truth reflected in nature—an annual reminder that death is not permanent. Grass that looks dead, brown, and beaten somehow thrives again. Bulbs buried in the dark soil send their shoots toward the light, and flowers triumph afresh. Hope is always part of the landscape.

Beloved religious leader Gordon B. Hinckley said: "There is nothing more universal than death, and nothing brighter with hope and faith than the assurance of immortality. . . . What meaning would life have without the reality of immortality?"1

When we feel discouraged, when life seems bleak and gloomy, we can remember the One who declared, "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25). On that first Easter morning long ago, the promise of new hope and everlasting life filled an empty tomb: "He is not here: for he is risen, as he said" (Matthew 28:6).

It can be exciting and fun one moment, just as it can be frightening and exhausting the next. Even as we stand in line and wait for our turn on the ride, we are never fully prepared for what lies ahead. 

Life is like that. We understand that family life and relationships will occasionally include some heartache, and yet we willingly sign up. We know that school and work will be challenging and even a little overwhelming, but we forge on. And even knowing there are ups and downs ahead, most of us would not choose to go back. That tells us much about our innate ability to take on challenges, to overcome obstacles, and to move forward with faith. For we each soon learn that happiness and heartache, joy and sorrow, are all a part of this journey we call life. 

Take, for example, high school sweethearts Darrell and Dorothy Brown. They planned to get married as soon as Darrell graduated from college in 1942. But World War II was raging, and life seemed so unstable. After careful consideration, they decided to go ahead with their plans to marry. They enjoyed a beautiful wedding day and shared 10 happy months together before Darrell was called into active duty, just days after Dorothy gave birth to their baby daughter. Within one year's time, they had already experienced quite a few of life's ups and downs—but it was only the beginning. Many, many more would follow in the nearly 70 years they shared together.

Certainly, challenges and difficulties lie ahead on life's roller coaster—for each of us. But we eagerly get on, hold on, and carry on, because we know that each dip in the ride is just preparation for the exhilarating part up ahead.

Whether it's fictional or real, from our family history or our own lives, each story includes its share of heartaches and joys. Many are characterized by moving, poetic declarations of love and devotion. But the stories that stand the test of time are those that chronicle love in action: lived affection and demonstrated caring. 

Russ and Valerie's love story is just that kind of story. Throughout their many years together, Russ was always generous with compliments. He often told his sweetheart what he loved about her appearance, her cooking, her efforts, and her hard work. Russ found ways to make Valerie's life easier. When he retired two years before she did, he prepared dinner every night so it was ready when she walked through the door. And although Russ was in intense pain during the last years of his life, he continued to find ways to show love. On holidays, anniversaries, birthdays, and just whenever he felt like it, he would give Valerie flowers, a little gift, or a handwritten note of love and appreciation. He was always thinking of her. 

After nearly five decades of marriage, Russ passed away and left his sweetheart to reminisce on all of the laughter, love, and devotion they shared. Valerie said it this way: "Do I feel cherished? Oh, make no mistake—it was the little things, the thoughtful, sweet things that Russ did every day that showed me how blessed I am." 

The words of the Apostle Paul provide a time-honored description of authentic love, which Paul referred to as charity. "Charity," he said, "suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not . . . , is not puffed up, . . . is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; . . . beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth." 

All of these things are manifest in actions, not just in declarations. In the end, love is not something you say, it's something you do—little by little, every day, year after year. This is the kind of love that never fails.

With a few rare exceptions, most of us genuinely care about the well-being of others, and we do our best to help and not harm. And yet in our technology-filled world, we sometimes don't even notice others or their needs, and so our good intentions go unfulfilled.

Cell phones, computers, and other high-tech tools enrich our lives in countless and amazing ways, but they can also distract and even endanger us. Ironically, they can make us aware of current events a world away but oblivious to what is happening around us. In a sense, life may pass us by because our heads are down, our ears are plugged, and our thoughts are elsewhere. Just a few weeks ago, a woman stood for quite some time in a grocery line next to her neighbor, but both were so focused on their smartphones that they did not even notice or speak to each other. 

As one writer observed: "Our use of technology has fundamentally changed not just our awareness in public spaces but our sense of duty to others. Engaged with the glowing screens in front of us rather than with the people around us, we often honestly don't notice what is going on."  

Some have found it helpful from time to time to unplug certain devices and just listen and look—truly take in the array of sights and sounds, truly look at the glorious world and the people in it. One man found that turning off the world's noise during his drive home from work helped him relax and arrive home refreshed. A family with grown children decided to be more intentional about making time for face-to-face conversations, not just screen-to-screen interactions. 

There's no doubt we live in a wired world, but we also live in a world of real people. We can choose to turn our thoughts to them and tune our hearts to their needs.

Aired January 26, 2014*NewVideo*The Unfolding Story - The Spoken Word**rG2W3NA8dk4**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rG2W3NA8dk4/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**We never know the whole story of anyone's life. We might know bits and pieces, parts of a person's background or circumstances, but never the whole story.

For example, it's estimated that more than 15,000 books have been written about Abraham Lincoln and another 50,000 about the Civil War. And yet, with all those volumes, more will yet be written. More details will be revealed, and each will be examined from new perspectives in the coming years. And even then, we will not know the whole story.

Likewise, each life is an unfolding story—a story of growth and learning and change, a story of happiness and heartbreak, a story of success and sorrow. So perhaps we ought to be a little more patient, a little more forgiving. Perhaps we ought to be slower to judge and quicker to love.

Many years ago, a 14-year-old girl contracted a terrible case of chicken pox. Fever burned its way through her body, and before long, the unsightly pox erupted all over her skin. She missed several days of school before the doctor assured her that she was no longer contagious, though her face was covered with scabs. 

Mustering all her courage, she boarded the junior high school bus that first day back. A thoughtless young man called out and made fun of her scarred face while his friends laughed. She pretended not to hear them as she walked toward an empty seat. If only they knew the whole story. If only they knew how difficult it was for her to face her peers that day. 

Never forget that every life and every occasion is unfolding in a unique and distinctive way. We may know some, but never all, of the story; so err on the side of compassion. Hold off on criticism and sarcasm, and never withhold kindness and mercy. And then, someday, when the whole story is finally written, we'll be thankful that we were able to contribute—at least in some small way—to a happy ending.

Aired February 2, 2014*NewVideo*Love, Loyalty, and Belonging - The Spoken Word**eM1OR_EcnGc**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eM1OR_EcnGc/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Every parent knows that being a good mom or dad is the most difficult job in the world. No challenge is greater than giving your all to raise a child to become a responsible and honorable adult. And while it can seem exhausting and never-ending at times, the day soon comes when that son or daughter leaves home. It can be as challenging to see your children go as it was to raise them. In some ways, perhaps it's even more difficult. 

But giving them wings to fly and find their independence is the task of parenthood. And that's the great irony of parenting—if we do it well, our children grow to need us less and less. As we truly, without guilt or overprotectiveness, set them free to find their calling in life,1 they leave with a sense of confidence and an assurance that, whatever happens, they are loved. And then, in moments and decisions large and small, thoughts and hearts return to the home that's filled with goodness and love.

Of course, no home, no parent, no son or daughter is perfect or without some problems. But that's the process of life. We give our hearts, we do our best, we learn and grow, and we become better and wiser. Life changes, children grow up and leave, and it seems that things will be forever different. And yet, though circumstances change, in a way they remain the same: We may not live together anymore, but we will always love each other. We may not see each other every day, but we are loyal and true to the timeless values taught and happy memories experienced in the home. We may move far away for a season, but always we are linked together—we forever belong to one another. 

That sense of love and loyalty and belonging between parents and children can remain with us always. No matter where we travel, in our hearts we can ever be homeward bound.

Even when it's a positive change, it can be hard to let go of the familiar past and step into an uncertain future. But while we certainly can't live in the past, we can always learn from it. Jeffrey R. Holland expressed this truth in these words: "We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. . . . Then we look ahead and remember that faith is always pointed toward the future."1 

Faith is believing and hoping that no matter how things have gone in the past, they can get better. Faith is forward-looking; it empowers and inspires us to action; it moves us to do more and to become better.

This kind of faith is robust and realistic; it is not fairy-tale or make-believe. Consider the great challenges throughout history that have been overcome by courageous people—including yourself! Yes, you've made it through tough times and done hard things before. With that ringing endorsement from the past, you can face the future with faith. An overwhelmed new mother knows she can become a good mom because, if nothing else, she has learned how to love. A first-semester college student knows she can tackle a busy term because she has worked hard and managed her time before. A man bravely battles a crippling illness because he knows this is hardly the first challenge he has faced. 

Even if the new year, new day, or new challenge seems more difficult than anything you've faced before, the fact that you've come this far reveals that you have it in you to succeed. Draw strength from the past, but don't get stuck there. Look to the future with faith, and remember that the seemingly small victories you collect now are laying the foundation of great success in the future.

Nelson! - The Spoken Word**_jwK8TWOCQM**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_jwK8TWOCQM/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**When Nelson Mandela strode onto a Johannesburg field at the final of the 1995 Rugby World Cup wearing the shirt of the largely white national team, the entire stadium was stunned. Here was the new president of South Africa—the first black man ever to hold that office—wearing the green shirt that for millions of blacks symbolized the indignities of white rule. But Mandela saw the national rugby team as an opportunity to unite and heal his fractured country, and he had called for blacks in townships across the nation to wear green shirts in support of the contest as well. 

As he congratulated his nation's rugby players, the stadium of more than 60,000 erupted into a chant: "Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!" That day South Africa won much more than a rugby match.

History is marked by great leaders whose moral influence has steered the future of nations. In that list of luminaries stand people like Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela. While they lived on different ends of the earth, each perceived an injustice and chose to do something about it. They championed the value of all people, seeking what Mandela described as a "democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities."1 It wasn't easy—Mandela spent 27 years in prison for his efforts—but remarkably, those years produced a man who sought peace, compassion, and understanding, not retribution and revenge. 

This is not the work of a select few. Each of us can reset history, even if it's only our own. Each of us can champion peace and harmony, even if it's only in our family or workplace. Mandela's leadership reminds us that true success comes from humility, love, sacrifice, forgiveness, and most of all, patience. He spoke for all of us when he said: "I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my walk is not yet ended."2

Its influence is felt both in our personal lives and in the course of history—perhaps most powerfully in the way it has given voice to noble causes throughout the ages. Never was this more evident than during the civil rights movement of decades past. Martin Luther King Jr. said of that era's "freedom songs," "I think they keep alive a faith, a radiant hope, in the future, particularly in our most trying hours."1
 
Martin Luther King loved music; his messages vibrated with stanzas of sacred songs, from "Precious Lord, Take My Hand" to "Amazing Grace" to the "Hallelujah" chorus from Handel's Messiah.
 
When they weren't being quoted in speeches, these hymns, spirituals, and other folk songs were being sung at rallies and gatherings—the historic march on Washington in 1963, Martin Luther King's funeral in 1968, and many others. On one occasion, at the conclusion of a meeting at his home, King stood with his colleagues as they sang, "There is a balm in Gilead, to make the wounded whole." It was one of his favorites, for the words soothed his soul:
 
Sometimes I feel discouraged
And think my work's in vain,
But then the Holy Spirit
Revives my soul again.2
 
Martin Luther King's work, thankfully, was not in vain. And we owe at least part of his success to the beautiful music that inspired, encouraged, and unified those who devoted their lives to that work—the work of freedom and liberty.
 
And though our personal needs and causes may seem less lofty, music can do the same for us. Whether we need comfort and peace, encouragement, or a reminder of God's love, music can—like nothing else—revive our soul and give voice to the yearning of our heart.

At first, some of the younger children were a bit frightened by the sights, smells, and sounds of the inner-city shelter. They had never been so close to such distress before. But, in time, a little Christmas miracle took place. 

As the family served the hot meal, they began to interact with the homeless residents. They exchanged smiles, laughter, and small talk. Then the singing started. No one really remembers who began to sing first—perhaps one of the residents or one of the children—but before long, everyone was singing Christmas carols. The room filled with the sweet spirit of Christmas. It became like a great party, almost a family reunion. They were no longer strangers but brothers and sisters, children of the same God. It was powerful, personal, and poignant—a night never to be forgotten.

In Charles Dickens's "A Christmas Carol," Scrooge's nephew Fred describes Christmas as "a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people [around] them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys."1 

No heavenly angels sang that night at the shelter—at least, not in the literal sense—but heaven came closer to everyone there. As the evening ended and the family stepped back into the cold night, they each felt the joy and meaning of Christmas more deeply. The stars shone a little brighter, hearts had opened freely, and they all felt a little closer to a few of their fellow passengers on the journey of life.

Aired December 30, 2012*NewVideo*Resolve for a New Year - The Spoken Word**AvutxZLX-UQ**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AvutxZLX-UQ/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**The prospect of a new year can give us a sense of opportunity, possibility, and purpose. We feel more determined to try a little harder, reach a little farther, and somehow do a little more. What before may have seemed out of reach suddenly enters the realm of possibility when we resolve with newness of heart.
 
Some time ago, a young adult discussed with his roommate the fact that he was not a "morning person." He explained that for as long as he could remember, he had never been very cheerful in the morning. His roommate simply replied, "If you don't like that about yourself, why don't you change?" The young man responded with feelings of doubt. "I've just always been this way," he explained. "I can't change that." But his roommate persisted, "Why not try?"
 
And so he did. Sooner than he expected, the young man really did change. With some determination and effort, he found that he could be as pleasant in the morning as he chose to be. Of course, he had occasional lapses, but by and large, he became the "morning person" he never thought he was. The hardest part, it turned out, was convincing himself that he could change.
 
Some day we might look back on our lives and wonder what we could have been if we had believed in ourselves just a little more.1 As we do, we will also see how even small changes—seemingly insignificant decisions—set our course and shaped our lives for the better. If we want to be, we can be better parents, better friends, better neighbors. We can be more patient, more forgiving, more cheerful—regardless of how we may have been in the past.
 
May this time of newness deepen our resolve to focus on the things that matter most, to live and love more fully. May it be a season of renewal and reflection as we strive to become the person God knows we can be.

The ancient city of Bethlehem is located along an old caravan route a few miles southwest of Jerusalem. It was known as the City of David because it was there that the prophet Samuel anointed young David to be the king of Israel (see 1 Samuel 16:1--13). Today it is known as the long-foretold birthplace of the King of kings, Jesus Christ. It has been referred to as a "little town," and indeed it was 2,000 years ago. But from small things very often comes that which is great—"the hinge of history," one writer observed, "is on the door of a Bethlehem stable."1

Traveling to Bethlehem today would be a long and costly journey for most of us. Few are fortunate enough to go there; most of us will never see it in person. Nonetheless, our hearts and our actions can take us to Bethlehem every day. And very often the journey may be as important as the actual destination. 

The way to Bethlehem—and to the King who was born there—is marked by good thoughts and good deeds. We go to Bethlehem every time we turn the other cheek and respond with kindness instead of anger; we journey to Bethlehem when we open our hearts to others and let them into our lives—even when it's inconvenient or difficult; we travel to Bethlehem as we set aside selfish pursuits and focus our thoughts and energies on the things that matter most; and we go to Bethlehem as we hold on to hope in the face of discouragement and tribulation.

The journey to Bethlehem is not just for a day or even a special season of the year. Truly, it is the journey of a lifetime.

We give thanks for their sacrifice as we imagine the countless lives that they will touch for good.

And we commend our loved ones who choose to serve. Often we even remind them of the timeless truth that in the course of such service, the giver typically benefits just as much as the receiver. Surely they will grow in character and compassion as a result of their labors. They will need such reminders on days when opposition is great and successes are few, and they wonder whether anyone is really benefiting from their efforts.

But there's another group that we often overlook when we calculate the consequences of selfless service. It's a hidden group we've never met—the unborn children and grandchildren who will someday hear of this caring service, whose lives will be forever enriched by a selfless example.

Whether or not our service takes us far from home, we are crafting the story our posterity will hear. One man died before knowing his grandchildren, but today they are growing up learning of his goodness, and they want to live up to Grandfather's legacy, even though they've never met him. They are heirs to a rich inheritance indeed.

A mother, setting the example of helping her neighbors and people she meets each day, teaches family values to her children. Without needing a word of instruction, they will model their lives after the acts of charity she offered. And the tradition will live on as their children observe and emulate their parents as well.

Regardless of the service we give, there will be times when the blessings seem obvious and bountiful. But there may also be times when we feel lonely and unproductive. At such times, it helps to remember the far-reaching impact of our loving actions and kind deeds. Such service is almost always multi-generational in its blessings. 

Episode 4392. Aired November 17, 2013*NewVideo*The Lessons of Our Lives - The Spoken Word**8pM2dbOvEyg**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8pM2dbOvEyg/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Obituaries are snapshots of a life. In short order, they give us a glimpse into a person's experiences and character. Granted, they do not claim to paint a complete picture—every life is more nuanced than what can be summarized in a few lines in the newspaper. But there's something noble about focusing on the positive in an effort to pay tribute and respectfully say goodbye.

Sometimes an obituary comes along that reveals a life of such wisdom and character that it inspires even those who never met the deceased to live a little better. 

Recently, a mother's five children penned "A Love Letter to Mom" to honor her at her passing in her early 90s. They published their letter in her obituary in the local newspaper. One did not have to know this beloved mother to appreciate the simple but profound truths her children learned at her knee over the years. They reported that from their mother they learned:

To love fiercely, and tell people before it's too late.
To be loyal, always.
To enjoy life—one bite at a time.
To laugh easily—with others and at yourself. ...
To be generous with your time, money, and heart.
To love [yourself].
And to never forget that God adores [you].1

After her long and productive life, these are the teachings and example that lingered in her children's hearts and minds. 

What are the lessons, example, and wisdom we hope to leave as a legacy of our lives? There's an important lesson in this dear mother's life well lived: Of everything we can leave to our loved ones, virtues like love, generosity, and loyalty—recurring themes in this "love letter"—are what they will remember and cherish the most. Such virtues make up the legacy that our children and grandchildren will carry into the next generations. Truly, a good person, even in death, lives forever.

Episódio 4340. Transmitido em 18 de novembro de 2012.*NewVideo*Life is a Gift - The Spoken Word**HhnJwNLREkQ**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HhnJwNLREkQ/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Have you ever received a gift that you could tell was made just for you? Not something that was mass produced and purchased from a department store, but something a loved one caringly crafted with you in mind. Maybe the craftsmanship wasn't perfect, but you were more than willing to overlook any imperfections because you could sense the love of the giver in the gift.
 
It has been suggested that "if we thought of life as a gift, we might not demand nearly as much from it."1 One family who sees life as a gift started a tradition that before eating their family dinner, they would take a moment to express a prayer of gratitude. It's a little thing, but it reminds every member of that family to look heavenward and acknowledge the source of their good fortune.
 
No one's life is perfect, but everyone's life is a gift. One woman who was experiencing many of life's challenges and sorrows decided that she would set her alarm five minutes early and spend those extra minutes lying in bed thinking of all the good things in her life. She has followed this ritual for many years now, and though she gets a little less sleep every night, the spirit of gratitude starts her day off right. Not only does it help her recognize her blessings, but it also helps her enjoy them more fully.
 
Perhaps we ought to be a little more deliberate about seeing the simple goodness that surrounds us. Some days it's not easy to count our blessings, but those are the days when it's most important to try. Think of the air you breathe, the beauty of the earth, the loving people you know, and the good things that fill your days. Look for them, and be grateful for them. Rejoice in the gift of life, and you will begin to feel the love of the Giver of the gift.

And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed...
 
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
 
And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem;...
 
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
 
And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
 
And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
 
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
 
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
 
And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
 
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
 
And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
 
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly host praising God, and saying,
 
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

Episode 4340. November 18, 2012*NewVideo*What Matters Most at Christmas Time - The Spoken Word**oCuQsBTd-sc**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oCuQsBTd-sc/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**In 1783, after eight years of war, General George Washington wanted to be home for Christmas. He had been with his small band of soldiers, experiencing the hardships and horrors of the Revolutionary War, since his commission in 1775 as commander in chief. In 1776 he spent Christmas crossing the Delaware amid ice floes and bitter winds. In 1777 he spent Christmas searching surrounding farms and towns for something—anything—to bolster his hungry, freezing, and in many cases shoeless soldiers at Valley Forge. And so it had gone year after year.
 
With victory secured in 1783, General Washington headed for Mount Vernon, stopping along the way to greet crowds and conduct a few final acts of official business. "Among [these]," he wrote in a letter to a dear friend and fellow soldier, "none afford me more pleasure than to acknowledge the assistance I have received from those worthy men whom I have had the honor to command."1 His last stop was in Annapolis, where before Congress he officially resigned his commission.
 
He then pointed his horse home, across the Potomac, through woods, up hills, and across the fields, orchards, and meadows until he could see in the distance the windows of Mount Vernon, candlelit in welcome. Two terms as the first President of the United States were in his future. But that could wait. Tonight was Christmas Eve, and his family was waiting for him.
 
Unfortunately, not everyone can be home for Christmas. But even if our loved ones can be with us only in spirit, Christmas is a time to cherish the warmth and affection of family and friends. It's a time to share with those we love our most precious gift—our time. Whether it's the joyful laugh of a favorite uncle, the contented smiles of grandparents, the excitement of children, the embrace of one who is home at last, or the traditional reading of the story of the babe in the manger, Christmas is best celebrated with people we love.

Home to the smell of pumpkin pie, home to a familiar soft chair, home to the people we love most in all the world. As we celebrate Christmas in comfortable living rooms, around tables filled with food, among family and friends, soldiers all of the world know that coming home for the holidays may only be a dream this year. Especially during the holidays, their service and sacrifice is poignant.

Far away from home, they not only lay their physical life on the front line of battle, they also put their personal and family life on hold as they serve their country. Through the decades, over generations past and present, soldiers from all nations have said goodbye for a time to the people they love so that people they don't even know can enjoy the blessings of safety and comfort. All the while, these brave men and women keep the home fires burning in their hearts. 

During World War II, a soldier named John Walls was stationed in Okinawa. For days, hot, humid, nerve-splitting days, and horrible long rainy nights, the soldiers held their positions. Many panicked, withdrew, and lost their lives. John knew he had to find peace if he was to keep his sanity, so he thought of the most peaceful place on earth--home. Using his helmet and knife, he started to sculpt in the muddy earth. He fashioned a miniature version of his living room at home, a shelf for his radio, a table for his food, a comfortable chair, pictures in frames on the walls. Then he settled back in his lounge chair made of mud and felt a beautiful sensation fill his tired body and anguished soul--peace. He had created a place of peace in the midst of war. 

When home is a place of peace, it's strength can be felt thousands of miles away, not just during the holidays, but the whole year through. May it be that when soldiers and their families, and each one of us, think of home, we feel the silent and holy "peace of God, which passeth all understanding."1

The older a child gets, the more she insists on feeding herself—no matter how messy it gets. To the child (and, to a lesser degree, to her parents) the increased independence is well worth getting some food on her face, on her clothes, and even on Mom and Dad.

As we mature, we continue to value independence. We respect those who stand on their own two feet. We may even come to believe that asking for help is a sign of weakness, that to be strong means not to need anyone.

But soon our challenges become more complicated than handling a spoon properly, with consequences more serious than a stained shirt. Commentators Richard and Linda Eyre put it his way: "We realize how little we know, how little we can control, and how dependent we are on things beyond ourselves. Those humble thoughts lead us to prayer and cause us to appeal to a higher, brighter, more knowing power. Particularly in times of crisis, in times of loss or of danger, we come face to face with our own frailty, and it seems both natural and necessary to turn to prayer."1

When problems seem unsolvable and too complex to handle, we can go to the higher source of wisdom, light, and love. Perhaps we can relate in some way to Abraham Lincoln when he said, "Sometimes I am driven to my knees by the simple conviction that there is nowhere else to go!"2

Prayer is not weakness; it is our access to true strength. Prayer can fortify us for the battles ahead even while it humbles and softens us in times of trial. Ironically, it actually increases our independence, while at the same time opening our hearts to heavenly help. Instead of "When all else fails, turn to heaven," perhaps a better motto is "Turn to heaven at all times and places."

Episode 4292a. December 18, 2012*NewVideo*Important in the Life of a Child - Spoken Word**S186CwWoCtw**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S186CwWoCtw/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Two busy parents of a large family recently discovered the difference one caring person can make in the life of a child. It's a simple story, really, and similar stories take place often and all around us, but the results are sometimes profound. Their six-year-old son, Micah, was stubborn about learning to read. Although he was capable of reading, and his parents worked with him daily, his skills were limited because he refused to practice and learn. 

When Micah's Sunday School teacher asked him to read something in class, he told her that he could not read. The teacher mentioned this to her friend Lynn, a retired schoolteacher. Unable to bear the thought of a child who can't read, Lynn called Micah's mother and respectfully offered to help. Although the mother was a little embarrassed and unsure that anyone could succeed with her headstrong son, she graciously accepted the offer. 

Within minutes of arriving at their home for their first lesson, Lynn won Micah's affection. She continued to volunteer her time and skills to helping Micah over the course of several months. Before long, Micah was happily reading above grade level, and his thankful mother now had some ideas on how to teach her two younger children to read when they were ready. Since then Lynn has become a dear friend to the entire family. 

This is a story about a caring and effective teacher, but it's more than that. It's a story about someone who made a difference in the life of a child. It's a story about someone who not only could help—but did help. What we offer doesn't have to be much; it begins with sensitivity to a need, a simple desire to lend a hand, and an effort to step up to the challenge. 

Perhaps you've heard this saying, written by another person who made a difference in the lives of young people—a Boy Scout leader of decades past:

"A hundred years from now it will not matter what my bank account was, the sort of house I lived in, or the kind of car I drove. But the world may be different, because I was important in the life of a [child].

Our highs, our lows, and so much that we love. Take away American music from the American story and you take away a good part of the soul of the story. It's impossible to imagine life in America without it. Without "Shenandoah," or "Amazing Grace," or "Over the Rainbow," or "Oklahoma," or "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," or "America the Beautiful." Or Gershwin, or Copland, or Scott Joplin, or the music of Christmas in America. 

I would like to tell you the story of a classic American Christmas carol and song, two of my favorites, they both figured in one of the darkest times ever, during the second World War. Shortly before Christmas 1941, Prime Minister Winston Churchill at considerable personal risk crossed the Atlantic in great secrecy to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place only weeks before. On Christmas Eve, from a balcony at the White House, the two leaders spoke to a crowd of twenty thousand gathered in the twilight. As reported in the Washington Post, "A crescent moon hung overhead To the southward loomed the Washington Monument as the sun dipped behind the Virginia hills."

President Roosevelt pressed a button to light the Christmas tree, then he spoke to the crowd, and by radio, the world was listening. "Our strongest weapon in this war," he said, "is that conviction of the dignity and brotherhood of man which Christmas day signifies." Churchill began his remarks, "Here [he] was," he said, "far from [his own] country, far from [his] family, yet I cannot truthfully say that I feel far from home. Here in the midst of war, raging, roaring over all the lands and seas, creeping nearer to our hearts and homes, here amid all the tumult, we have tonight the peace of the spirit in each cottage and every generous heart. Here, then, for one night only, should be a brightly lighted island of happiness and peace."

The following morning, Christmas day, the Prime Minister and the President went to church, where with the congregation they joined in singing, "O Little Town of Bethlehem," which Churchill had never heard before. 

The words of the hymn, one of the most beloved of Christmas carols, had been written long before by a famous American clergyman, Phillips Brooks, after a visit to the Holy Land. On Christmas Eve in Jerusalem in 1865, Brooks road through the dark by horseback to the place above town where he was told the shepherds had gathered with their flocks. After returning to his church in Philadelphia, in an effort to put down on paper what he had felt that night, Brooks wrote a poem. Then a few days before Christmas, 1868, he asked the organist of the church, Lewis Redner, to put the poem to music, that it might be sung at the Christmas service. Redner tried, but with no success. Christmas Eve he went to bed feeling he had utterly failed. "My brain was all confused," he later said, "but I was roused from sleep late in the night hearing an angel strain. Seizing a piece of music paper I jotted down treble of the tune." 

Churchill had spoken in his remarks from the White House balcony of every home as "a brightly lighted island" in the dark. In the first stanza of "O Little Town of Bethlehem" is the line, "Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light." I like to think of Churchill and Roosevelt singing that line in particular, at that time. And as would be said of the Prime Minister, he always sang lustily, if not exactly in tune. 

By 1942, with the war still raging, more then one million Americans were serving over seas, in sixty-five parts of the world. And it was with those men, and women, and their families in mind, the two talented New Yorkers, lyricist  Kim Gannon and composer Walter Kent went to work on a new Christmas song. Walter Kent had already composed "The White Cliffs of Dover" which had become nearly an anthem in Britain. Now they wrote "I'll Be Home for Christmas," which in simplest terms, expressed the longing for home and light in the darkness felt by so many, so very many. "I'll be home for Christmas, there the love light gleams. I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams." When recorded by Bing Crosby in 1943 it became the most popular holiday song of the time, more even then "White Christmas."

History isn't just dry dates and statistics, history is human, history can be a great source of strength and affirmation, an aid to navigation, especially in dark and dangerous times. And the words and music we love, and that have stood the test of time, mean still more when we know their story.

So busy were his days that he rarely had contact with old friends and saw little of his wife and two sons. One evening he called home and, for the sixth night in a row, told his young son he would miss seeing him before bedtime. His son responded with a request: "Would you wake me, Dad, when you do get home?" 

Reich was hesitant: "It will be really late." 
But his son insisted. "I just want to know you are there," he said. 

It was a wake-up call for Reich. He needed to simplify his life. He started by making a career change.  

What would a simpler life look like for you? Can you picture it? Where would you start? You might begin by taking an inventory of what you do and why you do it. Too often, we pay little attention to what we really value and allow the less important aspects of our lives to consume us. A little introspection often reveals that in the grand scheme, positions and possessions are not as important as we sometimes treat them.

Simplifying our lives may not require dramatic changes like quitting a job or moving across the country. More often it means increasing the time we spend with our family, close friends, and the people who really matter. It means cutting back on clutter—around the house and in our head, limiting what we worry about so that we have more time and energy for the important things that are within our control. Often it means saying no to requests that merely take time and have little lasting value. And it means finding renewal in relaxation, quiet moments, and the beauty of nature—ideally in the company of someone we love.

Whatever simplifying means to you, don't wait until your loved ones start to wonder if you are there. Decide what you can do to begin living a simpler life today.

Kennedy spoke to members of the First Armored Division in Fort Stewart, Georgia, who had been deployed during the Cuban missile crisis. During his speech, he recited a poem:

"God and the soldier, all men adore
In time of danger and not before
When the danger is passed and all things righted,
God is forgotten and the soldier slighted."

He continued by saying: "This country does not forget God or the soldier. Upon both we now depend."1

There are many ways a country can remember, ways we can show that we will never forget. In the United States, November 11th has been designated as Veterans Day, a day to "solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and ... reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring peace so that their efforts shall not have been in vain."2

But remembering does not happen on one day alone. We honor best those who have defended our freedoms abroad by defending each day those same freedoms here at home. We honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country by willingly making our own daily sacrifices for the common good. This is how we as a nation show that we will never forget the soldiers or the worthy cause they fought for. 

As we consider our soldiers past and present, let us give thanks that they are willing to give their all, even their "last full measure of devotion"3 in serving this land that we love. May we never forget God or the soldier.

The threat of Nazi concentration camps was increasing, but Viktor had found a way out: a visa that would allow him to take his new wife and his promising career to America—and to safety. 

But Viktor knew that when the Nazis came, they would take the elderly first—including, likely, his aging parents. They would need his care and support. Anguished, he searched his soul and sought heavenly guidance about what to do. 

Then, one day, he came home to find a piece of marble on the table. His father explained that he had retrieved it from the rubble of a nearby synagogue that the Nazis had destroyed. Coincidentally, it was a fragment from an engraving of one of the Ten Commandments: "Honour thy father and thy mother." 

Viktor had his answer. He stayed with his parents in Austria, and within a few months, Viktor, his wife, and his parents were arrested and taken to a concentration camp.
 
Over the next three years, Viktor discovered an important difference between those who survived the camps and those who did not: a sense of meaning. The ability to find meaning even in horrific circumstances, he observed, gave prisoners resilience in the face of suffering. 

After the war was over, Viktor wrote a book, Man's Search for Meaning, describing what he learned. It took him nine days to write and eventually sold millions of copies. The Library of Congress has listed it as one of the 10 most influential books in the United States. 

In one way or another, we are all involved in our own search for meaning. Our ability to find it depends a lot on where we're looking. We're likely to discover, as Viktor Frankl did, that life's true meaning does not come from pursuing our own happiness but from sacrificing for something bigger. Whatever that something is—family and friends, faith and community, volunteering and serving others—it can give our lives more purpose than we could ever find in just ourselves.

A river guide gave them clear instructions to make their trip enjoyable and safe. In particular, he warned them about a stretch of river where a bridge produced a strong undercurrent. He instructed them to get out of the river at that point and carry their tubes to the next launching area.

All went well, until one adult family member decided to ignore the river guide's warning. The detour seemed like an unnecessary limitation. Besides, he had floated the river before, and he knew what he was doing.

It was a mistake. The violent undercurrent flipped his tube over and plunged him into the water. Luckily, his life jacket kept him afloat, and all he lost were some of his belongings. It could have been much more tragic. He quickly realized how much better off he would have been to avoid the danger zone all together.

Life, like an unpredictable river, is fraught with danger zones—some of them obvious, but many of them unseen. Are we sometimes content to follow the current of popular culture or popular opinion, wherever it might take us? Often the best course is to heed the advice of those who have foreseen the dangers, those who are wiser and better informed, even when it is inconvenient or unpopular.

The counsel to avoid these dangers may at first seem like an unnecessary and unwanted restriction. Sooner or later, however, we realize that such counsel does not restrict our freedom; it protects it. Although we can choose to rationalize, reject, or ignore good counsel and divine commandment, the choices we make—though they may seem small and unimportant at the time—have lasting consequences.

To make it safely home, it is not enough to simply "go with the flow. "The safe course is rarely the path of least resistance; rather, it requires deliberate choices, willingness to learn, and humble recognition that we don't know everything. Truly, these choices determine our safety, our happiness, and our destiny.

Episode 4386. October 6, 2013*NewVideo*Hold On - The Spoken Word**xou5E9-yymk**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xou5E9-yymk/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Over a hundred years ago, Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote The Secret Garden, an enchanting novel about a young girl, Mary, who is orphaned during a cholera outbreak and sent away to live with relatives she has never met. Her childhood has been filled with loneliness and neglect, but Mary's personality begins to blossom as she and a young gardener bring new life to an old, neglected garden. Though the garden seems to be nearly dead, the gardener helps Mary see the dormant life in it, which together they nurture to full bloom. The garden becomes a place of healing not only for Mary but also for others who are suffering—including her sickly cousin and her sorrowing uncle. It is a reaffirming, hopeful message of the resilience of life—that people can change, miracles can happen, and everyone's story can have a happy ending. 

In a sense, we each have a secret garden that needs tending. It might be a relationship that needs a little extra care, a decision that needs to be made, a hope or a wish or a dream that needs some nurturing. Our garden may seem to be filled with weeds and thorns, but it is also filled with the potential to become lush and fragrant and beautiful. Even when life seems dark and hopeless, with some patient care and attention, things can always change for the better. 

In the Broadway adaptation of The Secret Garden, a friendly chambermaid uplifts Mary during a moment of discouragement with this inspiring message: 

When you see the storm is coming, 
See the lightning part the skies,
It's too late to run—
There's terror in your eyes!
What you do then is remember
This old thing you heard me say:
"It's the storm, not you,
That's bound to blow away." ...

Hold on,
Hold on. The night will soon be by.
Hold on
Until there's nothing left to try.
Child, hold on. There's angels on their way!
Hold on and hear them say,
"Child, oh, child!" ...
Hold on1!

Historically, a masterpiece represented an artist's finest piece of work, evidence that he or she, after years of perfecting a craft, had achieved the rank of master. Yet when we see or read or listen to a masterpiece, we rarely think of the time, the effort—even the mistakes—that accompanied its creation.
 It has been said that each of us is a masterpiece in progress. That may seem trite or clichéd, but it's a reassuring thought during those disheartening times when we feel like anything but a masterpiece.
 Everyone goes through those times, including people who seem perfect—which, of course, no one is. We all have strengths and weaknesses, positive and not-so-positive traits and habits. We all have occasions when we are and are not at our best. Even though our past may be marred by mistakes and disappointments, our future holds the promise of growth and improvement. Consider this wise counsel: "God wants to help us to eventually turn all of our weaknesses into strengths, but He knows that this is a long-term goal. Many of you are endlessly compassionate and patient with the weaknesses of others. Please remember also to be compassionate and patient with yourself."1
 No masterpiece is ever created all at once. So be thankful for the small successes, the simple joys, the good times, and even the hard times. Each one is another brushstroke, another stanza, another note toward the finished product. Each one gives us experience, teaches us, and strengthens us for what lies ahead. Life is a process of change and improvement: becoming a little kinder, a little stronger, a little better.  So be patient with the process, and remember that each of us is a work in progress—a masterpiece in the making.

In other words, even amid the difficulties and adversities of life, we can choose happiness and reject misery. Misery so often leads to a sense of defeat and despair, the feeling that life is either so painful or so hard that it's not worth trying. Although it's not easy at times, we have the power to choose.

Meg is a woman in her seventies who, like all of us, has known adversity. Her painful bursitis has kept her from moving as quickly as she once did. Eventually her medical problems left her homebound, but she chose not to be defined by her limitations. As she pondered what she could do, Meg got the idea to send cards to people. She quickly discovered that people love receiving cards. Hers are all homemade: she decorates them with beautiful photos and artwork; she tenderly writes personalized notes of encouragement and love. It's more than a hobby; it's her passion. She says that she just feels better when she thinks of others and sends them a card.

Her husband helps by buying stamps, and he buys a lot of them! Most days she sends out three or four cards, sometimes as many as seven or eight. That adds up to more than a hundred cards every month. She says, "I can't do much, but I can send cards." The grateful recipients know that Meg cares about them enough to take the time to send her love and encouragement.

This is how Meg chooses happiness. You may choose it in a different way. What matters is deciding not to dwell on the aches and pains, the struggles and strains of life. Instead, try to think of the beauty in the world, the good things that surround you, the people who could use a little care and encouragement and love. You'll find that happiness is not bound by our circumstances-rather, it is activated by our choices.

"Father provided well for our family," he said. "He always made sure we had what we needed, but the greatest gift he gave me was teaching me how to work." With tears in his eyes he continued, "Dad loved us, and he showed that love by helping us learn the joy of an honest day's work and a job well done."

Little of lasting value is accomplished without concentrated and often prolonged effort—just plain hard work. Much of the time, the real worth of an undertaking is directly related to how much work went into it. Whether the work is physical or mental or some of both, there is great satisfaction—even great joy—in seeing what comes of our own abundant efforts.

From the beginning of human history, our existence has depended on gaining our livelihood "by the sweat of our brow."1 It seems to have been divinely appointed that we should need to work for the necessities of life. Though that labor may be tiresome and sometimes feel like it's more than we can do, the Father of us all knew that the benefits of daily labor would far outweigh the burden.

For young people, it may be schoolwork, work around the house, or a part-time job that requires their labor. Adults work at increasing their skills and making a valuable contribution to their employer and to society. And a parent's work is never done. 

Everyone can find joy in honest effort, and old age need not change that. As one man entered retirement, he had no intention of leading a life without work. "I'm not retiring from something," he said. "I'm retiring to something." For him, the type of work may have changed, but it did not go away. In fact, working will likely prolong his life and give him fulfillment until the end. The author Pearl S. Buck has been quoted as saying, "To find joy in work is to discover the fountain of youth."

Work is a blessing and should be embraced with enthusiasm. May we find joy in our labors.

Delegates were expected to give the nod to well-known and experienced Senator William Henry Seward, with Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase the next most likely candidate and Judge Edward Bates another viable choice. The long shot was a one-term congressman from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, whose previous history at the ballot box was stacked with losses. They were all good men, but Lincoln seemed to lag in both respect and recognition among the competitors. As the balloting began, Seward placed first but not decisively, with a surprisingly strong showing by Lincoln. On the second ballot, Lincoln pulled almost even with Seward; and on the third, Lincoln registered a stunning victory. Months later, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States.

While Seward, Chase, and Bates grumbled about the outcome and envied the new president, Lincoln shocked the political community by appointing his three rivals to positions in his cabinet. The editor of the Chicago Tribune asked President Lincoln why he had made the surprising appointments of men who coveted his position and who might overshadow him with their political experience. "We needed the strongest men of the party in the cabinet," Lincoln replied. "These were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services."1

What a lesson in wise, big-hearted leadership. Who can tell how history might have been different if Lincoln had not been willing to place the good of his country above his personal pride and ambition?

Our decisions may not determine the destiny of nations, but they can influence, for good or ill, our cherished relationships. How many relationships have been saved when a good soul chooses to be happy—rather than envious—about a neighbor's success? Interestingly, Lincoln's surprising cabinet appointments not only blessed the country but also turned political rivalries into warm and respectful friendships.

Like Lincoln, we can stand above the fray and applaud the successes of others; we can see the good they have to offer and embrace their contributions. As we do, we will find ourselves and our relationships stronger as a result.

Unless something acts upon the object, it will remain in its current state of motion or rest. 

This law from classical physics has been used to explain the movement of everything from the smallest particles to the largest planets and stars. In some ways, it can even find application in our own lives. Perhaps you've noticed how momentum helps carry you once you've begun moving your life in a positive direction. On the other hand, you may also have noticed how that same momentum can make it difficult to break a bad habit or change directions and start working on a more worthy goal.

But there is one important way in which Newton's law does not apply to us: we are not objects. We need not wait for an outside force to act upon us. The power is within us to create our own momentum. If we sense the need to improve, we can make a plan of action. Even if it's only a few minutes a day set apart to focus on specific goals and clarify our principles, it will help us keep moving forward. 

When an important task is started, we can keep it going and see it through to the end. When a relationship needs attention and special care, we can focus on strengthening it. When a challenge or disappointment threatens to slow us down, our positive momentum and determination can keep us going.

Of course, there may be times when it's best to stop, reevaluate, correct our course, and then restart. While this can be difficult, how grateful we should be that we are not prisoners of the choices in our past! 

What will make the difference in our lives is not the speed or the swiftness with which we move but the steady, deliberate progress we make. You can access the power within yourself to direct your own life. Learn from past experience, stay on a path of improvement, and just keep moving forward.

Did it make you stop and wonder what traits or qualities stand out to others when they think about you? Consciously or not, we spend a lifetime crafting our reputation. Of course, we can't really control what people think of us, and it's neither useful nor healthy to worry too much about our reputation. But it's also true that a life well lived can have a powerful influence for good on those around us. We've all been uplifted and inspired by the loving sacrifices, anonymous deeds, and generous gestures of people who have touched our lives. Are we having a similar influence in the lives we touch?

Hearing a heartfelt eulogy at a funeral can inspire us with the desire to leave a meaningful, lasting legacy for our loved ones. But when the funeral is over, we return to the daily routine, and that routine has a way of distracting our attention from the things that really matter. Priorities sometimes get muddled, and we find ourselves putting self-interest ahead of family or career goals ahead of helping someone in need. Yet none of us wants it said at our funeral that we sure knew how to strike a hard bargain or climb the ladder of success—or even keep the kitchen windows clean. Somehow those things pale in comparison with acts of kindness, the nurturing of a soul, the outstretched hand to the less fortunate.

What do you want to be known for? Love? Hard work? Patriotism? Faith? It's never too late to start developing such traits. It's simply a matter of the small choices we make every day. Each choice demonstrates to others—and, more importantly, to ourselves—what we consider important. Then, perhaps one day, your loved ones will give a gift that reminds them of you—the gift of a meaningful, lasting legacy that they pass down to the generations that follow.

For one young couple, it happened when their twin girls were born. All of the anticipation and expectation of the long-awaited day became real as the new parents brought their babies home to a once quiet and calm apartment. How could they ever adequately prepare for such a moment? Their whole world changed as the size of their small family suddenly doubled. And yet, upon reflection, they realized that various experiences and events over the course of their lives really had helped them prepare to be the parents of these two adorable babies.

When people and moments meet, great potential that has been lying unnoticed inside us is revealed. Those moments, large and small, happen to all of us—in every season of life. A phone call or a blood test or an accident can immediately change everything. Some moments we anticipate, and we have time to prepare ourselves. But often they happen unexpectedly, without warning, in ways we couldn't have imagined. Either way, in time and with perspective, we begin to see how our past experiences have helped prepare us to rise to the occasion and do things we may have never thought we could. Though these moments can be trying, without them we would never know just how much we can achieve.

Remember the lyrics from the Broadway musical of decades ago:
Should you draw back the curtain,
This I am certain:
You'll be impressed with you.
On a clear day
Rise and look around you
And you'll see who you are.

When you meet your moment, face it with confidence. You'll find that you can rise to challenges, draw strength from the lessons of the past, and go forward into the future with courage and hope.

And so it seems appropriate, once or twice in a decade, to pause and reflect on the long legacy of our weekly broadcast, Music and the Spoken Word.

The Mormon Tabernacle Choir has been broadcasting since the early days of radio. It was in the middle of a hot summer in 1929 when the first broadcast of what became known as Music and the Spoken Word went on the air from the historic Tabernacle on Temple Square. It is now the longest continuous network radio program in the world, broadcasting each week from Salt Lake City, the Crossroads of the West.

A longtime adviser to the Choir reflected on this longevity with these words: "Through the years of the terrible depression, during the long season of the second world war and the wars which have followed, in times of peace and prosperity, [the Choir's] music has brought inspiration, increased faith, given courage, and comforted all who have heard it."1

Over its long history, the broadcast expanded to television, then cable, and then the Internet. Listeners and viewers have gone from crystal radio sets to 5.1 surround sound, from black-and-white to high-definition TV, from radio vacuum tubes to YouTube. Now the broadcast can be found online and on demand, in cars and on smartphones, on computer screens and flat screens. It's a very different world from the days of a single microphone dangling from the ceiling of the Tabernacle. And who knows what future innovations will carry the broadcast to the hearts of its listeners around the world over the coming years?

But one thing is certain as we begin our 85th year—the Choir and Orchestra will do their best to bring beautiful music and an inspirational message to grateful listeners. As long as there is a need for hope and beauty and goodness in the world, the Choir will continue to sing. As long as there is a longing for peace and joy in the heart, we will raise our voices in praises to God.

It seems that so many of our material things are made to be enjoyed for a brief moment and then thrown away. If something breaks or loses our interest, we quickly toss it aside and run to the store for a new one.
It wasn't always that way. Not too long ago, many of our parents and grandparents did not have the luxury of throwing things away. You've heard the pioneer adage "Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without." The pioneers were recyclers long before recycling was trendy. 

If an article of clothing became tattered or torn, they mended, patched, and wore it until it no longer fit—then they would cut it up and sew it into a quilt. When a dish broke, they crushed it and mixed it into plaster to make a building sparkle. They transformed husks of corn into dolls and human hair into intricate works of art. Old barrel rings and scraps of wood became toys. Everything had multiple uses; nothing went to waste.

Not only did they need all of their resources, they needed all of their people. Neither things nor people were considered disposable. Everyone from the young children to the elderly had chores, and the whole family depended on them. If eggs weren't gathered, they ate no eggs. If cows weren't milked, they drank no milk. If knitting and mending were not done, they had no socks or sweaters to wear. If dishes were not washed, they had no clean plates for dinner that night—paper plates were not an option. Everyone's role was important. Days were long and luxuries few, but they found happiness and a sense of purpose in their work and resourcefulness.

In our day of relative ease and plenty, the lessons of those pioneers are still relevant, though it may take more creativity to apply them in our families. Teaching our children to conserve resources and to fear "no toil nor labor"1may not be a matter of survival as it was for the pioneers, but it will certainly enrich our lives and deepen our happiness.

Episode 4375.

Researchers are finding that smiling slows down the heart rate, reduces stress, and can make you feel happier. In fact, some research suggests that the smile doesn't even have to be genuine—even a forced smile can have a positive effect on your well-being.² When you smile, you just feel better. 

Of course, on long, hard days it can be difficult to summon a smile or muster a grin. But that may be when a smile is needed the most. 

One dark, snowy winter day, a young man was walking across a deserted university campus on his way to an early-morning class. It was hard to find anything to smile about that cold and windy morning. And then he heard someone singing—loudly! As he got a little closer, he recognized his roommate walking toward him, singing at the top of his lungs, "Oh, what a beautiful morning! Oh, what a beautiful day!"³ It's practically impossible to sing those words without a smile. It can't be done. 

Now, some may say that this young man was silly or deluded, but those who knew him well understood who he really was—optimistic, upbeat, always on the lookout for the positive.4 

You can't always do much to change your circumstances, but you can always smile. Smiling is an outward expression of a full and abundant heart. 

So smile. Smile because you are alive. Smile because you live in a glorious world. Smile because there are good people around you who could use a smile. Smile because there's always the promise and hope that life will get better. Having the courage and disposition to greet others and yourself with a smile may be just enough to turn the day around.

Episode 4373. Aired July 7, 2013.*NewVideo*Acceptance and Appreciation - The Spoken Word**nGRlvm68uCE**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nGRlvm68uCE/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Sometimes relationships flounder because we don't convey enough genuine love—or perhaps we don't convey it in quite the right ways. In our zeal to help loved ones improve, maybe we focus too much on how we think they should change instead of communicating sincere acceptance and appreciation for who they are. Just as plants thrive in a warm and nurturing environment, people thrive when they feel accepted and appreciated. And very often they need that more than they need advice. 

One son felt that whatever he did, it was never enough to please his father. When he moved away from home and took a job in another town, he finally explained to his dad, "Our relationship isn't about productivity. You're my dad. Sometimes I need praise more than a push, and approval more than advice. Constantly trying to make me better just makes me feel worse. It's not enough that you love me. I need you to appreciate me."1

His dad meant well; he wanted his son to reach his full potential, to be the best he could possibly be, with minimal risk of failure. But our loved ones are so much more than productivity projects. They don't need better efficiency models—they need our love and care, our acceptance and appreciation, our best efforts to cherish their unique individuality. 

Sometimes it's not easy, but it becomes easier as we truly open our hearts. As we do, we open doors to more trusting relationships. People will often stop resisting change and improvement when they feel valued, when the relationship is built on acceptance and appreciation. For example, a patient, accepting grandma often gets further with a struggling child than a frustrated parent who condemns and finds fault. She's not blind to the child's problems, but her wise counsel and occasional correction are more likely to be accepted because the child knows he is accepted. 

Warmth and nurturing kindness will bring out the best not only in ourselves but also in those we love.

"Now I can get emails and pictures over the Internet," she says, so happy to learn about technology that could help her stay in touch with loved ones.

Elsewhere, an elderly man sits quietly in his favorite chair. He has just finished a fascinating book and is thinking about what it means to him and what thoughts he will share with his friends when they meet to discuss their latest reading.

Another woman, a grandmother of many, makes her way every week to a class on Italian literature. She is by far the oldest in the class but still eager to learn.

As these examples show, we are never too old to learn. The world around us holds enough surprises, enough new insights, and ample sources of new information to keep all of us busy for a lifetime. We call this the "information age," but age should never limit our desire to expand our knowledge and enrich our minds.

Of course, not all learning is of equal value. A wise man once said, "Some things that are true are not very useful."1 As information becomes easier to access—but not always easier to understand—the counsel of the ancient Proverb becomes ever more timely: 
"With all thy getting get understanding." 2 Without it, we may be "ever learning, [but] never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."3 The best learning is focused on things of value—things that will inspire and inform us and allow us to uplift others.

Newspapers, books, scriptures, websites, television programs, and magazines can all be great sources of learning. Formal classes offered at a school, informal conversations with a knowledgeable expert, and independent searching can all yield hidden treasures of knowledge. No matter where we are in life, to keep seeking and learning and questioning and sharing will lead to a life well lived.

She wanted to find out how they reached this significant accomplishment. Many people assume that they are just smarter than their peers. But the researcher found in these young people a trait more important than intelligence: she found tenacity. She writes: "The finalists are willing to forgo the immediate gratification of watching TV or texting friends so they can spend hours and do the tedious and merciless ... work. They write out thousands of flashcards with words and definitions and memorize them."1 These teens succeed because they are willing to resist the tugs and pulls of idleness and ease. With the encouragement of supportive parents, they just work harder and never give up.

In the process, they likely discover an important truth: the thrill of victory comes not necessarily from winning, but from doing our best, giving our all, and enduring to the end. On the other hand, the agony of defeat comes not so much from losing, but from quitting.

The same applies to any worthwhile goal—whether it's completing a 5K run, graduating from college or vocational school, writing a book, composing a song, or raising a strong family—all these take tenacity, the willpower to see it through to the end. That "end" may be different from what we envisioned, and it may change over time, but the only way to get there is with tenacity.

The root of the word tenacity is a Latin word that means "to hold fast."2 And sometimes, holding fast to our goals and dreams may mean letting go of less important pursuits. But it does not feel like a sacrifice, because even if we never win a spelling bee, we can experience the thrill of victory if we have the tenacity to never give up.

Episode 4369. Aired June 9, 2013*NewVideo*The Lesson of the Spoon - The Spoken Word**3TIYNFNq4Gs**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3TIYNFNq4Gs/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Sometimes we can learn great life lessons from the simple things around us. Have you ever looked at your reflection in a spoon? When the inward-curving, concave side is turned toward us, our image is reflected upside down. But if we turn the spoon around so it is facing away from us, we appear right side up again.
 Perhaps this simple truth about spoons applies to life as well. When we turn ourselves inward, getting wrapped up in our own worries and our own concerns, our life can become distorted, as upside down as our reflection in the spoon. We become self-absorbed and maybe even self-pitying—a path that leads to discouragement and misery. Problems seem larger than they really are, our life can feel out of control, and contentment eludes us.
We can correct this the same way we correct our reflection in the spoon—by turning to face outward. When we turn toward others, taking interest in their lives and serving those in need, life is right side up, as it should be. This is the secret to making our life better—seeking to make life better for someone else. When we focus upon serving and being useful, we feel valued and important. Our joy and satisfaction automatically increase.
Psychologists have confirmed the connection between service and happiness, well-being, self-worth—even physical health and longevity.1Even more convincingly, people who have given of themselves in selfless service can confirm from their own experience that life is better when we focus on others instead of ourselves.
The great philanthropist Albert Schweitzer spoke from personal experience when he said: "I don't know what your destiny will be, but one thing I know. The only ones among you who will be truly happy are those who have sought and found how to serve."2Turning toward others really is the key to keeping life right side up.

Aired May 19, 2013*NewVideo*The Warm Embers of Love - The Spoken Word**6tzt0E27uB8**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6tzt0E27uB8/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Most marriages start out like a glowing fire, full of warmth and light. But anyone who has been married for very long knows that keeping a marriage burning strong and healthy takes effort and commitment. Like a fire, love needs constant attention and nurturing through words and acts of affection and selflessness. 
  
There are as many ways to strengthen a marriage as there are married couples—the key is to find what works for you. One couple found that a daily walk gave them opportunity to talk, share feelings, and stay close. Another couple leaves little notes for each other every day. Usually it's just a line or two, but it helps them remember why and how they love each other. Another couple hangs play tickets or other reminders of their upcoming dates where they both can see them. All week long, they look forward to the time they will share together, just the two of them. 

You're never done strengthening your marriage. A lifetime of daily choices, large and small, are needed to fuel the embers of loyalty and love. "Support your [spouse's] values, goals and dreams, and greet his or her good news with interest and delight," says one expert. She suggests that even a fire that seems to have gone out can be rekindled with intentional caring, compassion, and companionship. "A marriage that has been marred by negative, angry or hurtful remarks can often be rescued by filling the home with words and actions that elicit positive emotions."1 

It need not be any more complicated than asking ourselves each day, "What can I do for a few minutes today to make my sweetheart's life better?" Simple actions, like sincerely listening, helping out, sharing an amusing event, smiling, or being good-humored, can rekindle the embers of love. In this way we live by the homespun wisdom of the familiar counsel "Choose your love; love your choice."

They quickly realized that their boats were completely at the mercy of the current; if it led a boat into a whirlpool or a patch of reeds, that's where the boat stayed. "Toy boats," he observed, "[have] no keel for stability, no rudder to provide direction, and no source of power. Inevitably, their destination [is] downstream—the path of least resistance."1
Are we sometimes like toy boats? Do we passively let life take its course, allowing one day to flow into the next, without a sense of purpose? Dr. Patricia A. Boyle and her colleagues recently conducted a study indicating that having a mission in life can "help stave off cognitive decline and promote a broadly healthier, longer life."2 When you set and pursue meaningful goals, you help your brain, your body—your life. 

There are so many ways to add purpose to life. And it doesn't need to be anything grandiose. "The first step," Dr. Boyle explains, "is to think about what is important to you, what energizes and motivates you, what gives you the sense that life is meaningful."3 

Some volunteer to help those in need. Some become mentors, sharing their wisdom and experience. Others focus on self-improvement, learning a new language or a new skill. One young man spends months training guide dogs for the visually impaired. A busy young mother finds a few minutes each morning to think of ways she can influence her children for good. A grandma who can no longer write calls her friends and extended family members on special occasions. Each, in his or her own way, finds purpose. And although life can be demanding and tedious at times, when we decide to live with purpose, the quality of our life improves. We don't just float; we sail purposefully to our destination.

Convicted of treason, he swears in rash anger that he wishes never again to hear the words the United States of America. The judge decides to grant his wish, and he is sentenced to a life of exile. Those around him are ordered never to speak to him of America. He comes to be known as "The Man without a Country."
 
Years later, a remorseful Nolan pleads with a young sailor:
 
"Remember . . . your Country, and that you belong to Her as you belong to your own mother. Stand by Her, boy, as you would stand by your mother."
 
Then he adds, "O, if anybody had said so to me when I was of your age!"1
 
Each of us has a land we call our own. It may be the place where our family has lived for generations. It may be the country of our birth that we left long ago. Or it may be an adopted nation we now consider our home. By virtue of our heritage or our loyalty, we all feel connected to a country.
 
Love of country inspires men and women to give their very best, even their lives if necessary, to uphold its freedoms. In faraway places or just down the street, we stand tall for the worthy values and principles espoused by our nation. When fellow countrymen are in trouble, we reach out to assist them, defend their rights, and rebuild their lives. The bond of common citizenship unites us and strengthens us in spite of differences of race, religion, or politics. The commitment we swear to our country is, at its heart, a promise to help one another.
 
We all have a country. It may not be the largest, the richest, or the most powerful, but it deserves our loyalty and our love and our best efforts to make it better. We can say with hope and faith, "God bless this land."

Episode 4364. May 5, 2013*NewVideo*Things to Be Desired - The Spoken Word**KP2P6rTFChg**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KP2P6rTFChg/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Max Ehrmann loved to write. And so, after practicing law for a few years and bouncing between the meatpacking and manufacturing industries, he set it all aside, picked up a pen, and turned to writing full-time. Throughout his life he published books and essays and poems that reflected his wisdom, his passion for the written word, and his hopeful view of life.

His most acclaimed work, Desiderata, was published in 1927 but didn't become popular until well after his death in 1945.Desiderata, which in Latin means "things to be desired, "contains this insightful advice for all of us in our hectic, hurry-up world:

Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. 
As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. ...
If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. ...
Be gentle with yourself. ...
Whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. 
Be cheerful. 
Strive to be happy.

These wise words echo the peaceful whisperings of truth. They strike the same note as the ancient words of the Psalmist: "Do good; seek peace, and pursue it" (Psalm 34:14). 

As "noisy and hasty" as life may have been in 1927, the need to "go placidly" seems even greater today. How might the world be different if shrill, hateful voices were met with truth spoken "quietly and clearly"? We may not be able to change the world in all the ways we would like to, but if we truly do "keep peace in [the] soul," we will see, as Max Ehrmann did, that "it is still a beautiful world."

Episode 4318. June 17, 2012*NewVideo*Good Fathers - The Spoken Word**RKFVBthuaVk**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RKFVBthuaVk/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**The son of a renowned scientist recalls a powerful teaching moment that strengthened his relationship with his father. When the son entered college, the father encouraged him to follow in his footsteps and major in physics. One day the son was struggling with a complex mathematical problem and asked for his father's help. They went to the blackboard they kept in the basement, and the father started writing.

Suddenly, the father stopped and asked: "Hal, we were working on this same kind of problem a week ago. You don't seem to understand it any better now than you did then. Haven't you been working on it?" When the son replied that he had not, the father questioned further: "When you walk down the street, when you're in the shower, when you don't have to be thinking about anything else, isn't this what you think about?" Hal confessed that he did not.

It was a very tender and poignant moment, because Hal knew how much his father hoped he would become a scientist. The father paused for a moment and said: "Hal, I think you better get out of physics. You ought to find something you love so much that when you don't have to think about anything, that's what you think about." Hal took his father's advice and went on to a distinguished career as a professor. Even though the father would have liked his son to share his passion for science, most of all he wanted his son to do what was best for him.1

Some fathers want their children to be just like them. Most fathers hope their children become better than they are. And good fathers are able to put their aspirations aside and help their children define and achieve their own life's dreams; they let go of their own desires and encourage their children to go after theirs.

Wise counsel, a worthy example, and empowering love are the building blocks of good fatherhood. Truly, a father's work is never done because it lives on in the lives of his children.

No matter the language, culture or continent, what a difference a mother makes. She is the purveyor of love and tenderness, which prompts nation after nation from America to Ethiopia, Thailand to my homeland of Wales to honor mothers with a day of tribute once a year.

The Welsh word for mother or mum is mam. Think about it; she is the one person who loves us unconditionally, who cares for us without limits, who never tires of us and makes us smile time and again.

Each one of us holds in our hearts special memories of our mothers and of those who have also stood at our sides—grandmothers, aunts, sisters, neighbors, and teachers. These women have held us accountable, taught us the basic strengths of society like truth, honor, mercy, goodness and loyalty. I think of my own "mum and aunties" attending my many singing performances beginning at age 4.  They have been cheering me on ever since.

Wales has a particularly precious tradition of showing love—the giving of love spoons.  It began in the sixteenth century when young men would fashion a carved wooden spoon as a declaration of love and commitment to a young woman.  But as the years have passed, this common kitchen utensil turned work of art has become an expression of love. Many a Welsh mother's home displays love spoons from those she counts dear.  My mum included.  Carved from one piece of wood, be it sycamore, oak, boxwood, yew, or even fruit tree, the love spoon is decorated with designs of flowers representing affection, diamonds for good fortune, a wheel showing support, a lock for security, a dragon for protection and a heart -- of course -- for love.

So it is with us.  Carved in each of our hearts is a mother's love.

The Internet provides almost instantaneous information; communication crosses oceans and continents in a flash. Nearly all of us live fast-paced, hectic lifestyles. Like the view of the countryside from a speeding car, life sometimes seems to go by in a blur.

The speed of life can be exhilarating but also exhausting. Fulfillment is usually found not in something up ahead that we're pursuing but in the good things around us that we rush past in our haste. From the sacred suggestion to "consider the lilies"1 to the modern admonition to "stop and smell the roses," we have all been invited to slow down, even for a few moments, and enjoy the beauty of the earth.

When we dash past a flower, we have missed an opportunity to consider one of nature's most beautiful creations. Sunsets happen every day, but how often do we stop to let those moments of serenity and beauty lift our spirits and increased our peace? A short pause to feel the breeze on our face, to appreciate a towering tree, or to listen to the song of a bird can clear our minds and refresh our perspective, giving us renewed energy and motivation. 

A kindly grandfather sat with his young granddaughter on a park bench. "Listen," he said to her, "to the sound of the wind in the trees. The trees are speaking to you." With innocent awe, the child asked, "What are the trees saying, Grandpa?" "Whatever you need to hear," he replied, "Whatever you need to hear."

Perhaps God has a message for each of us in His glorious creations—if we will only take a moment to stop, observe, and listen. As a wise man once said, "Where there are eyes to see, there will be visions to inspire."2

Where no rockets fly nor bullets wing;
Our broken brothers let us bring
To the mansions of the Lord. . . .
 
No more bleeding, no more fight;
No prayers pleading through the night;
Just divine embrace, eternal light
In the mansions of the Lord.1
 
This stirring hymn was written by Randall Wallace and performed by the Armed Forces Chorus for President Ronald Reagan's funeral recessional in 2004. It is a song for soldiers—for brave men and women who give their all to uphold freedom.
 
Oh, that there can come the day when wars shall cease and peace shall reign on the earth. In the meantime, let us strive to be people of peace, and let us honor those who answer the call of duty to preserve that peace. Let us remember, on this day and always, the men and women who died while serving our country.
 
One family woke up early on Memorial Day to attend a sunrise service at the local cemetery. They braved steady rain and cold morning temperatures to see flags fly and to hear retired soldiers play taps. They listened to community leaders recall the sacrifices of those who had served their country so well.
 
They knew that this day of remembrance is so much more than the start of the summer vacation, more than picnics and parties and a day off work. It is a day to honor, to remember, and to cherish freedom and those who defend its cause. It is a day to recommit to our civic duty and to uphold the principles of freedom. It is a day to give fervent thanks for that eternal light and divine embrace in the mansions of the Lord, to which we have entrusted our beloved fallen soldiers.

She was so exhausted she wanted to cry, but she didn't even have the energy for that. She looked around the room and saw a day's worth of clutter and too many chores half-done or not even started. "I can't keep up," she thought to herself. "There is no end to it, and I'm a failure at all of this." She felt worn out, used up, and quite unappreciated.

Then her eyes caught hold of a work of crayon art stuck by a magnet to the refrigerator. At the bottom of the drawing was written in a child's hand, "I love you, Mom." She saw little handprints on the patio door and realized that someday soon those would disappear and the sweet child who left them would be grown and gone. She felt the lingering warmth of the goodnight hug she received as the last child went off to bed. As tears filled her eyes, the sight of the clutter dimmed, and she saw two things clearly: it was worth it, and she was good enough.

What mother hasn't felt just as tired and hopeless as this one did? But when we see beyond the demands of daily living, keep a long-range view of things, and recognize the things that matter most, there can come into our hearts the assurance that our efforts are truly worth it, that they are making a difference. What we are doing, though probably not perfect, is surely good enough. 

Dear mothers, close your eyes to the clutter, forget for a moment the things you haven't been able to do, and know that you are loved, that your sacrifice is of great worth, and that you are more than good enough. God bless mothers everywhere.

Episode 4313. May 13, 2012*NewVideo*The Power of Music - The Spoken Word**9sVfvWdIQIA**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9sVfvWdIQIA/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**Music has been called the timeless and universal language—a language of peace, of love, of hope. No matter where we live, regardless of our age and stage of life, music can lift and inspire us, it can soften and console us, it can instruct and entertain us. Such music becomes like a lifelong friend—we can recall lyrics and tunes we haven't heard for decades, because they seem almost to be burned into our soul. 

While music affects us very personally, it is also communal; it unites people in a way few things can. As we sing or play together and listen together, we somehow connect on a deeper level. 

Of course, there's a wide range of musical tastes and preferences. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then good music is found in the ear of the listener. But in every style and genre, there is music that uplifts—music that brings cheerfulness and a smile, a fresh insight or perspective, a poignant remembrance or emotion, an inspiring feeling of rejoicing, gratitude, or worship. On the other hand, there is also music that can darken, degrade, or create a cloud of gloom. 

One family found that they could positively affect the tone of their home just by the music that filled it. The wise mother discovered that if she had good, uplifting music playing when the children came home from school, it helped the attitude in their home. When family members made conscious choices to listen to wholesome music, everyone felt a little better about life. 

Music that edifies will stand the test of time. It endures across the centuries and crosses every imaginable boundary because it touches something eternal deep within us. That's what makes it universal and timeless, and it's what inspired the 19th-century English poet Walter Savage Landor to declare: "Music is God's gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven."1

Sound bites have replaced conversation; texting has displaced telephone calls; rhetoric has supplanted dialogue; and multitasking has divided our attention. So often, listening isn't on the list of things to do and so it gets overlooked.
Famed solo percussionist and composer Dame Evelyn Glennie, who performed with the Tabernacle Choir during the 2002 Winter Olympics, began losing her hearing at age 8,and by 12 she was deaf. But though she could no longer hear, she found that she could still listen. "Listening to music," she contends, "involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your eardrums." She describes listening in her legs and feet, her face, her neck and chest. She performs around the world and, in one sense, never actually hears either her music or the applause it inspires. But she feels it and sees it and understands it deeply. Her goal, she says, "is to teach the world to listen"1  the way she does.
Evelyn Glennie's insights apply not just when listening to music but also when listening to people. So many cry out, "Listen to me," but only those who truly know how to listen can even hear them. Listening is much more than hearing with our ears. It requires shifting the focus from ourselves to someone else. It takes time and often is not convenient. With our ears, but also with our eyes, our minds, our hearts, and our actions, we say, "I'm listening. I'm hearing and thinking about what you are saying. You matter to me."

In this loud and noisy world, think how much it means to someone when you really listen, when you take time to understand their woes and challenges, their joys and excitement, their dreams and aspirations. Consider the gift of love you give when you show that you care by truly listening.

What should have been a routine treatment for the infection went tragically wrong, and he was left blind for the rest of his life. 

Tragic accidents like this one can sometimes discourage people from striving to achieve great things—but Adam was too young to know that. As he grew, he found that despite his disability, there were many ways he could serve his fellowman. He studied at the Philadelphia Institute for the Blind; became an accomplished writer of gospel songs, anthems, and cantatas; and eventually founded his own music company in 1906. 

One of his best-loved songs is "Called to Serve." Originally written as a children's marching song, it has since become an anthem that inspires millions to spread light and love to a world in desperate need of goodness. 

The words invite one and all to answer the call to serve:

Called to serve Him, heavenly King of glory,
Chosen ever to witness for his name, 
Far and wide we tell the Father's story, 
Far and wide his love proclaim.

In one way or another, this call to serve others comes to all of us—regardless of the weaknesses or limitations we think we have. There are people and hearts that only you can reach. Some of them may live "far and wide," but more likely they are close to home: a family member, a friend, a neighbor, even a stranger who happens to cross your path. Maybe some of these people are in your sphere of influence by chance—or maybe they are there specifically because you can love and lift them in a way no one else can. 

If you feel weak or unprepared for the task, don't worry. "God our strength will be" as we "press forward ever, called to serve our King."

Episode 4357. March 17, 2013*NewVideo*Giving Comfort - The Spoken Word**TmnJf1lEpzM**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TmnJf1lEpzM/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**The classic western film "Shane" depicts a tragic conflict between ranchers and farmers. In one scene, the distressed wife of a farmer, feeling a need for comfort in the troubled situation, runs to her husband's arms and says, "Hold me. Don't say anything. Just hold me—tight." She didn't need advice or even kind words, just the comfort and reassurance of her husband's embrace.

Have you ever wanted to comfort a loved one, but you didn't know how? Maybe you were afraid of overstepping your bounds or saying the wrong thing. Sometimes we don't need to say anything at all. We simply need to be available. One person who recently lost her father observed, "My friends were there for me. It was great, because they just acted normal. I wasn't ready to talk about my dad's death, but I knew when I was ready they would be there to listen."

Often the best way to give comfort is by offering a listening ear. More than anything, our friends who are suffering simply need to know that someone cares to listen—without judging or advising unless we're asked to. They need a chance to sort out and make sense of their feelings by expressing them to a sympathetic listener.

Then, when we see that something we can do would be comforting, it's often best just to do it. Many people who need help hesitate to ask for it. Knowing a young mother was ill, a neighbor brought over a casserole for the family's dinner—without waiting to be asked. One good man shoveled snow from his neighbor's driveway, knowing the older man would have difficulty doing it himself. Great comfort comes in knowing that someone is aware of us, loves us, and is willing to lend a hand.

We may think we don't know how to appropriately comfort others in times of need. But we do know how to love and care. It requires no eloquence, no special skills or training to show love. When our friends in need sense our love, then they will say with the Psalmist, "This is my comfort in my affliction."1

Life is full of little miracles, but this is perhaps the greatest miracle of all—to see people change, grow, and improve, day by day and little by little. 

Imagine how different life would be if we saw people not for who they are right now, but for who they could become. Think of how we might respond differently to a child if we looked past his failed and messy attempts to make something and into his productive, positive future. Consider the boss, spouse, teenager, or neighbor whose occasional annoying behaviors sometimes put us at odds. What if we could see them as the better person they might become? This may be the most important way we can change—in our ability to believe in and nurture change in others.

Clinton Duffy was a prison warden in the United States during the 1940s and 50s. He was well known for his efforts to rehabilitate the men in his prison. One critic who was skeptical of these efforts said to the warden, "You should know that leopards don't change their spots!" But Duffy replied, with the wisdom and perspective that comes of experience: "You should know I don't work with leopards. I work with men, and men change every day."1

It's not always easy to see others as they can become, and it very often takes patience and faith. Too often we give ourselves and others a reputation, a perception, that makes change difficult. But people can surprise us, even inspire us, with how they can and often will change for the better.

One by one they stacked the branches in a pile next to the creek in their backyard. As time went on, the mound grew into a mountain of wood, and they finally determined they had better move it to the street where it could be picked up and disposed of properly. 

They soon found that this task would be more difficult than they thought. First they tried to push and pull the pile toward the curb. Then they tried wrapping it in chains and dragging it. They tried to put a plank underneath it and slide it, but the huge pile would not budge. At last, a simple but profound idea struck them: they would need to carry the pile one branch, one limb, one piece of wood at a time. Over the course of several days, they moved the pile.

We've all had similar experiences when a problem, a project, or a challenge felt almost impossible, too large and difficult for our limited time, resources, and capacity. We may have felt frozen by fear, paralyzed by indecision—by not knowing where or how to proceed. And then we discovered the only way to proceed was simply to begin. Just begin! It has been said that the deed is half done once we have made a beginning. So we do what we can, no matter how small it seems.

It certainly requires faith, but that's the way challenges that seem insurmountable have always been overcome. Remember the children of Israel: after 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, they faced one final obstacle before entering the promised land—the River Jordan, overflowing its banks. The Lord parted the river, allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground, but only after they showed enough faith to step into the water.

When we feel overwhelmed, when the task ahead seems too great, we may just need to start by getting our feet wet! Step by step, little by little, great things will begin to happen. The Lord will bless our efforts and magnify our abilities, but we must first begin!

Episode 4360. Aired April 7, 2013*NewVideo*The Challenging Pleasures of Art - The Spoken Word**PgaGlYB1BVo**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PgaGlYB1BVo/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**A few years ago, Dana Gioia, a commencement speaker at Stanford University, expressed his concern about a culture that, little by little, "trades off the challenging pleasures of art for the easy comforts of entertainment."  

There's little doubt that entertainment can be worthwhile, fun, and exciting.  But when it's over, entertainment very often leaves us no better than it found us.  As Gioia explains, it "exploits and manipulates who we are rather than challenges us with a vision of who we might become."  

Art, on the other hand, does not try only to entertain us. It tries to teach us and stretch us; it can lift our spirits and even make us better.  As Gioia put it:  "You don't outgrow art.  The same work can mean something different at each stage of your life."1  It's not that the work of art changes—we change.  In fact, in a very real way, it's the art that changes us. 

Perhaps you have seen a painting or heard a song that you struggled to understand fully.  But then, as you studied or pondered it, your eyes were opened to a deeper beauty, a deeper truth, and the work of art became a treasure to you.  A young high school student experienced this when he was assigned to study a well-known poem.  It wasn't easy; it challenged and stretched him in unexpected ways.  But once he made the effort to appreciate the poem, to discover its meaning below the surface, he was invigorated by its richness.  Somehow, in small but important ways, it helped him see the world with a little more depth than he had before.  

Like anything worthwhile, art can be challenging.  But it is also enriching and inspiring, rewarding those who dig deep for its meaning with the ability to perceive more intently the beauties that surround us.

Episode 4338. November 4, 2012*NewVideo*Happiness - The Spoken Word**ULb-7TZtnQU**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ULb-7TZtnQU/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**The Gallup organization recently released a poll whose purpose was to measure positive emotions worldwide.  A thousand people in more than a hundred countries were contacted and asked about their previous day.  How often had they smiled or laughed? Did they feel respected?  Did they learn or accomplish something interesting?  According to the survey, the happiest people on earth live in panama and Paraguay, which happen to rank 90th and 101st in the world in terms of wealth.  In fact, none of the top 10 happiest countries would be considered wealthy by most measures.¹

Admittedly, no survey can accurately measure true happiness, but these results ring true.  While wealth, ease, and other external circumstances may influence our happiness, they do not control it.  Happiness, it seems, comes from some- thing deep inside us that we choose to nurture. We determine our happiness.  Otherwise, how do we explain why one person "can smile or find balance and perspective amid tragedy and despair, [while] someone else can be surrounded by all the good things of the world and yet wallow in gloom"? ²

A young man who recently returned from foreign service in a poor country noted that although the people he met there had very little, they were remarkably happy. And he found that he was happy too while purposefully engaged in helping them.  We've all had enough similar experiences to know that selflessly serving others deepens our love and increases our sense of fulfillment, that treating others with kindness and enjoying life's simplicities make us happy.  Then why do we waste energy seeking happiness in places we know it isn't found?  We know where to find it. 

That's a comforting thought. It means we can choose to be quite happy even if our circumstances are not ideal.  It means that true happiness is within reach for all of us.

While we all have our share of shortcomings, there is in each of us an abundance of goodness to celebrate. Wise people choose to focus on others' strengths rather than dwell on their weaknesses. 

Years ago, Sam Walter Foss wrote a poem that captures this sentiment well:

Let me live in a house by the side of the road,
Where the race of men go by—
The men who are good and the men who are bad,
As good and as bad as I.
I would not sit in the scorner's seat,
Or hurl the cynic's ban;—
Let me live in a house by the side of the road
And be a friend to man.1

When we choose an attitude of friendship rather than faultfinding, we surround ourselves with colleagues rather than competitors. It's easy to cast stones, hold grudges, and deride others; it takes more effort to forgive, to commend, and to love. But the dividends are well worth the investment. Think what would happen if we lived in a world of fewer critics and more friends, where people gave each other the benefit of the doubt. 

Gordon B. Hinckley, a beloved religious leader who lived well into his 90s, explained that somehow this gets easier over time. He said: "Age does something to a man. It seems to make him more aware of the need for kindness and goodness and forbearance. He wishes and prays that men might live together in peace without war and contention, argument and conflict."2

Life is hard and mean enough. Each of us has a place "by the side of the road," where we can choose today to "be a friend" and look for the good in others, and thereby replace the scorn and cynicism of the day with encouragement and hope.

Even after a long winter, spring always triumphs, and life is renewed: one blossom, one flower, one person at a time.
Spring is never more invigorating than in the life of an individual, especially one who has wondered if winter would ever end.

James was just such a man. After years of suffering the consequences of some poor choices, James decided to rebuild his life.  It was a heart-rending process, but over time and with consistent effort, he began to feel hope and newness of life. Still, he couldn't help but wonder if his imperfect past would forever limit his future.

But then, while building a new home for his family, James had a life-changing insight. He remembered his grandfather showing him how to carefully pound out the kinks in old, bent nails so they could be used again. And so he gathered discarded nails around the building site and started to straighten them—one by one.  He found that many of the rehabilitated nails worked just as well as new nails. In fact, it was the kinks in the shaft that helped them take hold of the wood.

James then realized that he was like a bent nail. He had needed straightening, but his difficult past had made him stronger and wiser. With gratitude in his heart, James keeps one of those straightened nails in his pocket as a reminder that he was given another chance at life. And he has made it his life's mission to help others find the hope he has found.

No matter what your life is like now, always there is hope. Bent nails can be repaired.  Broken hearts can be healed. Lives can be made whole.
The Lord's promise "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly"1 reaches into the eternities. New hope and new life can come to us all.

 1. John 10:10.

Work as though everything depended on you."
 
Indeed, our willingness to work can make a big difference in life. A leader who worked for several years in a service organization with hundreds of young men and women observed that the defining quality of the best young leaders was their ability to work. Those who knew how to work were happier, more confident, and better able to adapt to new situations. They were problem solvers. And most often, those young people went on to have successful lives. From early on, work spelled the difference.
 
And so we celebrate work. In the late 1800s, the United States Congress designated the first Monday in September as Labor Day—a day to commend work and those who do it. It's a day set aside to rest from labor, even as we remember all those who labor to build this nation: in the farms and factories, the offices and warehouses, the stores and schools—anyplace where honorable, honest labor is performed. Those who work fuel the progress of nations and the betterment of our communities. Truly, workers deserve a pat on the back and a heartfelt reminder of their importance in our society.
 
Work is good for the soul. It builds muscle and character, it strengthens hand and heart, and nothing gets done or moves forward without it. And though work is different today than a hundred years ago, it's still essential to life and happiness. Good work satisfies the soul and makes the world go round.
 
And so, on this day when we praise work and workers, may we roll up our sleeves and celebrate the blessing of work.

As creatures of habit, we tend to eat the same foods, take the same route home from work, and surround ourselves with the same people every day. There's comfort in the familiar—that's why we call it our "comfort zone."
 
But how many of the world's great achievements resulted from playing it safe? Accomplishments—including personal growth—happen only when we lengthen our stride, challenge ourselves, and reach out just a bit.
 
The child who learns to ride a bike, the grandmother who takes up oil painting, the student who enrolls in a difficult class—all leave their comfort zones to fulfill a dream. As a result, their lives became richer and their outlook brighter.
 
A nurse once asked several terminally ill patients to share any regrets they had at the end of their lives. She found that many felt they had not become everything they could have been—that they had left too many songs unsung. They wished they had lived up to their potential.1 By hanging back, afraid to try something new, we risk facing that same regret.
 
Often it's as simple as deciding to be a better listener or to perform a small act of service every day. Speaking a kind word to a stranger, lifting someone's spirits with a phone call—there are countless ways to try something new.
 
Once we take that step into the unknown—even if it's a small step—we discover that our comfort zone was actually holding us back. The satisfaction of conquering our weaknesses, the joy of expanding our ability to serve others, will more than make up for any "discomfort." We may even discover some truth in the phrase "Life begins where your comfort zone ends."

They might include a photo or knick-knack, an item that has special meaning. Perhaps they remind us of a loved one, a favorite vacation, a treasured memory, a special place or event. Some of these items are tossed aside after a while, forgotten in the midst of life's continuing onrush. But others are cherished reminders and markers along our life's path. They remind us of where we've been and what we hold most dear. 

Not long ago, a family trying to sell their home learned how meaningful these reminders can be. Their realtor advised them to remove the souvenirs and photos and personal effects from their house so that prospective buyers could imagine their own stuff in the home. For the next several months, their home, though less cluttered, felt very different. Yes, it was the same structure, the same walls and halls and rooms, but it lacked its heart, its reminders that love and laughter, experiences and memories, are what made their house a home. They couldn't wait until they would once again fill their home with the mementos and photographs that both shaped and described their lives. 

Such reminders and markers are unique to each individual and household, reflecting the personality and values of those who live there. They may have very little monetary value, but the treasures of the heart that they memorialize make them priceless. They warm our hearts and inspire us to cherish people and experiences. They help us remember and appreciate the past while at the same time helping us anticipate and look forward. Reminders and markers do just that: they remind us and help mark our life as we step into the future.

Various members refused to speak to each other, weddings went unattended, and children were growing up without knowing their cousins. The years had given family members plenty of time to justify their behavior and blame the others for their injuries.
 
And then, in a sudden impulse of generosity, a young aunt sent a package of school supplies to her brother's children. It wasn't expensive; it wasn't grandiose. It was just one simple gesture.
 
But like a drop of rain on parched, cracked soil, it caught the attention of a family thirsty for kindness. A thank-you note was written. A phone call was made. A caring comment was spoken. Feelings began to soften. And now a holiday feast is being planned. The prospects for healing and forgiveness are bright. And it all began with a small investment in just a few notebooks and markers.
 
Of course, reaching out with compassion across a bitter chasm is not easy. It may even seem impossible, and it always requires patience and persistence. But often just one simple gesture of kindness is enough to set in motion a series of actions that convey love and goodwill, balms that can soothe any wound.
 
We see the powerful impact of small gestures every day. The people who thank returning soldiers at an airport, a group of teens who visit patients in a hospital, even a young girl picking up the keys dropped by an elderly woman. These simple gestures seem small, but they stay forever in the hearts of the people they bless.
 
Like sunlight shining through a small crack in a dungeon wall, one small gesture can bring warmth to cold hearts. By responding to even the smallest of generous impulses, we just may witness a miracle that not only softens the hearts of others but also brings unexpected joy into our own.

Episode 4350. Aired January 27, 2013*NewVideo*Resilience - The Spoken Word**BFUCA3QsMhg**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BFUCA3QsMhg/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**You don't have to travel far down the path of life to realize that it's full of stumbling blocks. Avoiding them is an important skill, but perhaps even more important is the ability to pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and keep going after we've stumbled—and we all do from time to time. In the words of Confucius, "Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."1

He was describing resilience, the ability to rebound from disappointment, to work through adversity with courage and patience, refusing to give up or give in. It's easy to keep moving forward along the path's smooth patches, but if the whole path were that way, how would we ever learn to be resilient? How would we discover how much inner strength we have if we never had to bounce back after a difficulty, move forward through times of heartache and pressure, or stay strong in moments of gloom and discouragement?  Resilience reveals something about our character—and it can empower us to become even better, wiser, and stronger.

There are examples everywhere, large and small, of people who keep going despite setbacks: the athlete who keeps competing despite a less-than-stellar season, the job seeker who keeps his head up in the face of rejection, the student who keeps studying hard even after receiving a bad grade, the soloist who struggles in a recital but keeps practicing and shows up at the next one, the couple who remain committed to strengthening their marriage notwithstanding the ups and downs of life. They all bounce back, keep going, and keep trying even when, at times, they think they can't.

Perhaps the words of Christopher Robin to Winnie the Pooh are words we each need to hear from time to time: "Promise me you'll always remember: You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."2 So no matter the setback, keep going. It may surprise you to discover how brave, strong, and smart you really are.

"Every year, the last-ranking cadet to make it through to graduation is anointed the goat, showered with praise, given a dollar from every other fellow graduate—amounting to roughly $1,000—and granted the biggest applause at the graduation ceremony."1Some have called it the world's most prestigious last-place award.
It may sound like an odd endorsement of underachievement, but it is actually quite the opposite. On a day when the people at the top typically get the most recognition, West Point also recognizes those who just barely survived—usually because they stubbornly refused to give up. It's an honored tradition because it says something about the human spirit—no matter where we are right now, we can move past the labels others give us; we can improve, grow, progress, and come out just fine. In fact, it's worth noting that, historically, West Point's "goats" have often gone on to become successful in their chosen fields, some even to great acclaim.
Life is a long walk on a long road, and sometimes those who have early success fizzle out and fade away, while others who seem to be at the bottom find the strength and determination to rise above their challenges.
Indeed, ranking systems have often proven to be poor indicators of future success. In all areas of life, some graduate high, some low, and some in between, but what makes the difference in life is how we choose to respond to our setbacks—and our successes. A graduation, a promotion, an award or recognition, even a label, should not be the endpoint or conclusion to a life but an opportunity and motivation to keep trying.
Remember, whether we're doing great at the top or we're the goat at the bottom, what matters is what we choose to do with the rest of our life.

The high winds, heavy rains, and flooding often cause severe property damage and even loss of life. The chaos of evacuation before a hurricane and the human suffering in the aftermath make these storms among nature's most frightening.
 
A fascinating characteristic of hurricanes, however, is the calm eye found at the center of the storm. In the eye of a hurricane, there can be blue sky and a light breeze. Surrounded by high wind and pelting rain, the eye is a spot of relative serenity in stark contrast to the destructive forces that whirl around it.
 
Occasionally, the events of life may come at us like a hurricane. The winds of grief may blow against us, and the tide of stormy relationships may flood our hearts. It may sometimes feel like the sun is hiding behind a thick blanket of threatening clouds.
 
But like hurricanes, the storms of life can also include a calm eye—a peaceful place, an opportunity to recover our strength. If we take advantage of tranquil moments, we can find rest from the buffeting tempest. Prayer and meditation can bring us comfort in the most trying circumstances. Listening to inspiring music or to the counsel of a trusted friend can bring about a change of heart that will give us strength and inner peace. The support of those we love often brings the quiet courage we need to endure. Even a brief retreat into the calm can bring renewal and prepare us to go back out into the storm.
 
In the heaviest storm, amid the fiercest gale, there is an inner place of stillness. When the rain clouds gather and the winds of adversity blow hard against us, we can look for peace and rest in the eye of the storm.

But some tragedies are so horrific or inexplicable that they break the hearts of concerned observers across the country—even around the world. At such moments, complete strangers come together to offer sympathy, comfort, and help. The human family unites in a demonstration of compassion and goodness. We want those who suffer to know that even though they don't know us, we care about them. We want to somehow ease their suffering.

In his many decades as a rabbi, Harold Kushner, author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People, has met with countless grieving families. When he asks how they are able to cope, they answer almost unanimously, "Community, people suddenly emerging, neighbors, members of their church, total strangers coming up to them to hug them and offer a word of consolation." This response reminds him that even when a hardship seems inexplicably unfair, "people ... need consolation more than they need explanation. Feeling so singled out by fate, they need the reassurance that they are in fact good people and do not deserve what has happened to them."

"The God I believe in," Rabbi Kushner continues, "does not send us the problem; He gives us the strength to cope with the problem."1And most often, He sends that strength in the form of a caring, compassionate person—someone who can help us rise beyond "Why did this happen?" and instead seek answers to "What do I do now to keep my faith and hope strong?"

Opposition and heartache are a part of life. Good people suffer. But no one should suffer alone. We can be there to offer consolation in the spirit of these comforting words of the Psalm:"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber."2

1. (2001), xii, 171.
2. Psalm 121:1--3.
