This comment from President Thomas S. Monson comes nearly eight months after he announced lower age requirements for Mormon missionaries (men can serve at 18, women at 19) — an announcement that has generated a wave of new missionaries.

The Church, which has always followed Christ's New Testament teaching cited by President Monson, announced more developments in its mission to fulfill this charge. During a two-hour worldwide broadcast originating from the Marriott Center in Provo, Utah, Church leaders, missionaries and members were also encouraged to follow the Savior as they work together to bring others to Christ.

They are an integral part of a generation of digital natives, the first generation with no memory of life before cell phones and the Internet.

But Mormon teenagers are also different from some of their peers. Many attend scripture study classes each morning before school and meet with other young Church members once a week outside of church. They often pray and read scripture daily. They also naturally turn to technology to explore their religious beliefs, posting and discussing videos and quotes from Church leaders on social media.

For Mormon youth, religion is not a Sunday-only affair, but part of who they are. So when Church leaders determined it was time to revamp the lessons taught to youth on Sundays, they knew they needed to provide tools for them to integrate their faith into their digital lives.

Bishop H. David Burton was honored by Salt Lake Chamber with the "Giant in Our City" award on 16 March 2011.

"Bishop Burton lives to serve, to uplift and to build," Chamber CEO and president Lane Beattie said. "He has administered programs that provide care for those in need. As a passionate supporter of the arts community he has helped enrich the lives of thousands of Utahns. And as a businessman he has overseen the unprecedented investment in our capital city."

The Presiding Bishopric oversees the Church's temporal affairs, including distribution of tithing, humanitarian efforts and building construction. Since becoming the Presiding Bishop in 1995, Bishop Burton has overseen the construction of over 100 temples, 6,000 meetinghouses, the Conference Center, and the City Creek project in downtown Salt Lake City. The mixed-use City Creek development, which is the one of the largest construction projects in the country, will open on March 22, 2012.

Being the birth parents of this community has given us a special interest in and some responsibility for the future of this wonderful city," said Bishop Burton. "Our commitment to this city is broad and deep. Ever since Brigham Young said, 'This is the right place. Drive on!' we've been striving to do our part to make this city, in a mountain valley, a beautiful, vibrant place."

Pop singer David Archuleta and actor Michael York took center stage Thursday night to kick off the annual Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square concerts. 

Choir president Mac Christensen called this year's opening show "the greatest night we've ever had."A capacity crowd witnessed the performance in the Conference Center in Salt Lake City, and three more performances are scheduled. Two concerts will be Friday, 17 December, and Saturday, 18 December, both at 7:30 p.m. The weekly half-hour CBS radio broadcast of Music and the Spoken Word on Sunday, 19 December, at 9:30 a.m. in the Conference Center will also feature Archuleta and York. This will be followed by additional music from the previous performances in a mini-concert. (Attendees should plan on being in their seats 30 to 60 minutes before each performance begins and should not save seats.)

"It just seemed so unreal last night," said Archuleta, who has lived in Utah since age 10. "It was one of those moments where it was very hard to actually take it in and realize this is actually happening. ... I've always enjoyed listening to the Choir — I think they're my most listened to thing on iTunes. It's amazing. There's no place like performing here. It's really incredible having the Choir right behind you. It's like, 'Wow, is this really happening?'"*NewVideo*Laie Hawaii Temple Rededicated**e4qgEXMvC6s**{u'url': u'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e4qgEXMvC6s/default.jpg', u'width': 120, u'height': 90}**President Thomas S.

"The Lord's Prayer," featuring Andrea Bocelli, the choir and orchestra, and David Foster at the organ will be part of a PBS Christmas special produced by WNET. After several takes, David Foster then switched to the piano to accompany both the choir and orchestra for "The Prayer," a song he personally composed, which will be featured in an upcoming choir and orchestra recording. 

Between takes of the recording process, Bocelli sat down at the Tabernacle's famous pipe organ and gave an impromptu recital of "Ave Maria" while accompanying himself. 
"It was beautiful; his sweet voice carried throughout the Tabernacle," said choir member Robb Cundick, who also said the unplanned performance was his favorite part of the afternoon.

After the conclusion of "The Lord's Prayer," Bocelli said he had enjoyed his day in Salt Lake as well as singing in the Tabernacle. He complimented the Tabernacle acoustics and said that the entire experience was very moving.
"For me it was a huge experience," Bocelli said. "The quality of the choir is very high. ...

The Church provided the supplies, UPS provided the transportation and CARE International will oversee distribution in Myanmar. The relief effort was made possible by leaders of CARE International who have established relationships with Myanmar officials. CARE is one of the few agencies the local government has allowed in the country according to Garry Flake, LDS Humanitarian Emergency Response director.  

 "The shipment includes items such as sterile gloves, stethoscopes, braces, splints, syringes, needles and alcohol pads," said Flake. "Anything found in an emergency room." In addition, 13,000 first-aid kits assembled by missionaries at the Provo, Utah, Missionary Training Center last November were also included in the supplies, as well as hygiene kits, tarps, plastic sheeting and blankets. The Church also provided additional funding more than a week ago for immediate purchases. 

Flake praised UPS leaders for their generous donation of the use of an MD-11 cargo jet, fuel, pilots and ground support in transporting the goods to Myanmar. "This kind of commitment on the part of UPS speaks volumes about its leaders and their vision of how we can work together to make the world a better place," said Flake.

UPS will deploy a supply chain expert to Thailand to coordinate with the United Nations' logistics emergency teams already there to ensure that supplies are delivered to those in need. UPS employees will also assist CARE International's operation in Thailand by assembling the supplies into packages that can be distributed directly to families. 

"When you are putting together this kind of shipment, you are taking that which is relevant and that which will get to the end of the line," Flake said.

Cook, an Apostle for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, appealed to news media today to make a clear distinction in their reports between the Church and the polygamist sect in Texas which has made headlines throughout the world.

He praised news media that are making this distinction but expressed concerns about others who are perpetuating mistruths about the Church, whose members are commonly referred to as Mormons.

Elder Cook said it is very confusing to the public when some media use "Mormon" to describe the Texas-based polygamous group which is currently under investigation for possibly incidents of child abuse. He reiterated that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with over 13 million members worldwide, is not connected in any way to small sects that practice polygamy.

Drawing contrasts between the Church and polygamists, Elder Cook said, Church members do not live in isolated compounds, arrange marriages, dress in old fashioned clothing or wear unique hairstyles. 

Rather, they are contributing members of the communities in which they live throughout the world, get married at the average age of 23, and are well educated. In fact, 60% of Church members in the United States have some college education, which is 10% above the national average.

The students responded to a flood of text messages from teens in at least six states, suggesting they arrive at school in their "Sunday best," rather than their accustomed jeans or other casual clothes, as a symbol of respect and honor to their deceased leader. 

A few of these students shared their thoughts about President Gordon B. Hinckley.
