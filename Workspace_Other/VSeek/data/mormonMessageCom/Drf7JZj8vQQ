President Eyring is filled with the Spirit of God and it eminates from 
within..  I love this Apostle he reminds me of John beloved of God for his 
pure heart and his child like manner.  A truly sweet spirit.
 ï»¿I'm very much inspired! :')@David6801 He speaks with power and authority... its a beautiful thing to 
be able to recognize those who have the spirit of prophecy:)I'm catholic & yet I love this man's preaching. The holy Spirit is w him....I remember being at the MTC in 2003 when this man came to give us a speech. 
I will never forget the way I felt when he entered the gym where we were. I 
was away from church for some time but I could never deny what I felt that 
evening. He was certainly called of God.
