SUDhad so much fun being able to be apart of this video. Im proud to be a 
mormon. Church has been the biggest blessing in my life. Im so thankful for 
everything the church has given me.I always feel more lost when I am so busy that I am only doing things for 
myself. It is true that I we can only find ourselves when putting others 
before us.
