When he said "become worthy of emulation" the spirit testified to me that I 
must work to become a better person. This talk is inspiring and motivating. 
Thank you Elder Nelson :) ﻿Incredible. I needed to hear this today﻿I love this talk; one of the most amazing things that I pull from most 
every general authority that I hear is that misery remorse are always a 
choice: why should we feel sad for our sins when the savior has taken them 
away? It is always our choice to "choose liberty and eternal life through 
the great mediator of all time, or to choose captivity and death, according 
to the captivity and power of the devil" (2nd Nephi 2:25) That is the first 
lesson we must to learn before we can set a standard.BYU is seriously the most amazing place ever!nobody says the contrary. but that's not the point of this message. Did you 
watch it until the end?The feelings you're experiencing are essential for your progress, Now it's 
time to choose to change and never look back. I felt that same way before.I have experienced depression of spirit and guilt for my sins. They buffet 
me day and night, and so does temptation. Wickedness truly never was 
happiness.Hey you used the 2 word sermon from president uctdorf's talk.I can really feel how inspired this message was. Thank you!Open my eyes that I can seei love this message given by a servant of the lord . So glad I got to see this! Definitely a highlight of my year :)Q hermoso mensaje!!!!Thank you! (:I love this. I will study hard so that I too can be able to go to Brigham 
Young university!
