Though Loved It! @_@Love this!!!This is a beautiful video, with amazing young followers of Christ.thats wonderfulThey're really good at breathing together. I know that wasn't the point of 
this video, but it was still neat.Absolutely love this video.Chosen spirits,preserved for this last days to stand fast in the testimony 
of our Savior Jesus Christ and to proclaim His good news. Zion's youth, 
hope of this dispensation. There is a peaceful spiritual side to Vegas. But there is no where ever you 
are if you choose to Stand in a Holy place. Peace is in you not around you. Very Inspiring fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. What a lovely world this is, where God is alive and where there is no 
despair. This was such a great chance that we had to do this. I remember that when I 
sang this, I got sick that week but I was wonderfully blessed that my voice 
was able to be healed in time for me to sing that Sunday. It was so 
beautiful. Excellent motto: Bloom where you're planted. Love it!
