I'm no longer religious, but this is simply amazing. Never served at this location, but loved serving in the one in Chico, CA. 
It's always a touching service to put together supplies for those that 
would go without, otherwise. My mom and dad served in this very mission in Naperville IL. Thank you to 
the missionaries that have and are serving.Just imagine if everyone could be like this! There would literally be no 
poverty or hunger, and relationships could only grow stronger. It really 
does lift my spirits to know that there is still so much good in the world 
amongst all the wickedness and corruption.So awesome, service is a great demonstration of the Savior's loveOK, I've GOT to say it: The one fellow kinda looks/sounds like Ben Stein.
