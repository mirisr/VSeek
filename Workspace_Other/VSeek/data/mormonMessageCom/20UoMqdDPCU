Yeah, Latter Day Saints music.  I always enjoy the MoTab Choir.  Peace and 
Love.﻿only have white brothers? where are the black brothers? why?﻿then start by calling the bishop and asking for home teachers until and 
tell your bishop you want to come back but you need to start slow. and pray 
for help to go back and just watch what happens﻿Joseph cristina pls come back pls﻿I BELIEVE IN CHRIST Great musicI BELIEVE IN CHIRSTI BELIEVE IN CHIRSTMy Favorite Hymn!you should go back :) im no longer mormon but this song just brings back memories 'I believe in Christ' Great hymn!I love John Longhurst's hymn-tune for this great text! I often play it in 
settings other than LDS congregations as I believe totally true Christian 
peoples look to the same Person as Savior, Lord, Maker and Friend. When I 
listen to a recording it wells within me a vision of the day when we all 
shall behold Christ return to Earth in all power and great majesty to set 
His Kingdom here in the latest of the Latter-days. Surely that time cannot 
be too much longer. Let us hope and pray. This is a really good song!Pray for us in Cameroon that god should raise devoted men and women who can 
use their voices to praise the name of the Lord. I am blessed!!One of my favorite hymns.
