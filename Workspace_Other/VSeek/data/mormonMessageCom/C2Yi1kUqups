To dislike the video you're baiscally saying that you like that most 
teenagers act up in school, curse, and do other inappropiate behavior. You 
don't have to be mormon or even religious to be good but to dislike the 
video you're disliking people who are. As a teacher, I too often see 
students who one day are saying they believe in Jesus and the next day they 
are getting in a fight.Explain Joseph Smith.I used to go to a mormon church and got baptized and what not and they gave 
me the priesthood but..I don't know exactly what the priesthood. What is 
it? How inspirational. :)The world needs the Aaronic Priesthood!!..I like that partwhat an amazing organization for young men, you can see the strength and 
glowing happiness in each boys face.How could somebody dislike this video...its greatGlad I got to be part of some wards with boys that took their priesthood 
seriously when I was a boy.
