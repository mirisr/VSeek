I truly know that my Redeemer lives, & it does bring me peace & comfort!!!  
I know that He loves & cares for me, & He is willing to do All necessary to 
help me to gain an Eternal Reward!  Thank Thee, Sweet Jesus!!!﻿Oh thank you,﻿really touch my soul..wonderful hymn﻿Thanx Mormons bless uThis has to be my favorite hymn, topping my favorites. Awesome. One other 
is "How great thou art", but this really helps a broken heart. Earth is 
school, and hymns are a big part of it. - GeoffniceThank you for posting this and other videos. Being in the military in a 
spot where there is no branch and no other active members nearby, this 
blesses and strengthens me. The gospel is true.Beautiful...He lives !!I'm LDS but you don't have to be to love this choir or this song. "What 
comfort this sweet sentence gives" :)i feel like he should use his white stick to point to the words , like one 
of those childrens sing along videos. But on a more spiritual note i am so 
thankful for this being on youtube, instead of wasting my time i have 
really grown from watching conf . i know that my redeemer lives!!!!!January 1st 1970???!!?? Oops. ;-)hola "I KNOW that my Redeemer lives" ! ****this Hymn sung at our 181st
