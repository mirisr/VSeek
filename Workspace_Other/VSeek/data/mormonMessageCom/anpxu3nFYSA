I have learned that we must temper our experiences; this is to know what 
relates to our own personal beliefs & patterns developed from our family & 
parents, to spiritual experiences from the Holy Ghost, we can truly 
establish a communication & relate them appropriately. Sadly most people 
have not done this & have mixed personal experiences (sow - reap results) 
with Holy Ghost experiences, causing themselves & others confusion. This 
leads to misreading the Spirit & even misreading others. Amen
