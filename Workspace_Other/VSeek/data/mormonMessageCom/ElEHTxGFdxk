I love watching Mormon channel!﻿Why did people smoke in the first place? I mean I wouldn't have done it 
anyways because you can die from smoking!btw I haven't smoked﻿My Dad stoped Dring Beer But it was hard for him to do it﻿The question is... What is a disease? Only Christ is the true healer...
Just watched the "decision determines destiny" video and it is the same. 
Bad habits were cultivated and serve a purpise and is a desease. It's not 
just a question of decision. It's a question of leaving it to Christ to 
take care of it with his grace. It's only through relying on him fully and 
thus remember him always that habits can slowly change... The ultimate 
question... How can we always remember him? We hear this every Sunday, we 
truly wish it, but it doesn't happen... Why? How come? ﻿
