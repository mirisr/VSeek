Shane Warby is the baritone soloist.  This is the second time a soloist has 
sung in General Conference.  The first was a gal from Brazil that President 
Hinckley invited when he heard her sing in Brazil.﻿This has become one of my favorite songs to listen to. Thank you for 
sharing!﻿I want SO much to hug that soloist! Sublime voice.First solo since 2005Love it :) Ever since I heard it during conference, I listen to it when I'm 
feeling down
