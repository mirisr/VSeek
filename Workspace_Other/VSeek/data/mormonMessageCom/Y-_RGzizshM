Let Christ's eternal grace strengthen you. "Come", follow Him. This may 
mean doing those things that are uncomfortable and hard to do, like 
forgiving someone, going to partake of the holy Sacrament every week , or 
confessing that you cant do everything by yourself. God wants to help us, 
but He cant do so if we dont put in our effort and show Him we are willing. 
Trust in Him. Work for your Eternal Happiness. Only then will you find 
true, undescribable joy in life﻿I haven't attended church in a long time, but the hymns still pierce my 
heart like nothing else.﻿I sang this in 3 part harmony at my own baptism. Love this beautiful song.

conference now at ldsI believe"...."lI'm Momon and proud!!!!!!!!!!!:D
