Well done Sisters!!  Bravo!﻿Beauetiful choir.﻿It's so nice to see young girls look like wholesome, innocent youth today.  
There's not enough of this in today's society.  It also amazes me how many 
people show up to see and hear them!  The auditorium is packed!  I'd love 
to be one of the lucky ones to be there!!﻿Am proud to be a Mormon ﻿The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints or The Mormon Church as a 
short name. What church is this? It's awesome to hear the congregation and the choir all sing together. Very 
impressive sound!
