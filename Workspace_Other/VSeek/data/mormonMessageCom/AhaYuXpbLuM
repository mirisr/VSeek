One of our favorite sermons on the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, 
Another Testament of Jesus Christ. It invites us to come unto Christ and 
embrace the enabling and strengthening power of our Savior's Infinite 
Atonement to cleanse us as we strive to obey the commandments of God and 
prepare to return to our Heavenly Home. Combined with the Old and New 
Testaments we have an unshakable foundation to stand on as His followers 
and disciples.ï»¿
