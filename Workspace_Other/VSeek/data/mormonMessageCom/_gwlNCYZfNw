I know that our father in heaven loves us so much he sent his son so that 
we can come back to his presence. He loves us so much and is always there 
for us when we need him all we have to do is pray and he will love to 
answer us through inspiration and revelation from the scriptures, Holy 
ghost, and any way he can. I love him with all my heart and cry when he 
cries for wickedness of people. I cannot imagine this life without his 
guidance from the spirit. I testify that he loves everyone forever. This video went straight to my favorites list. Thanks for posting :)
