I was wondering if someone could help me find another rendition of this 
song. Its a female singing and it has a very jazzy feel to it (Norah 
Jones's type). I remember playing it in the car going from appointment to 
appointment but i can't find it! Thanks in advance!﻿I am a former member of the LDS Church, and still yet at this day I must 
say that there is nothing closer to HEAVEN than to listen to the Mormon 
Tabernacle sing hymns of faith and glory to the Lord.   Sometimes, I wish I 
knew if it was indeed the only True Church, it would make my life so much 
easier to direct.   But alas,  I stand in a corner and enjoy this beautiful 
heavenly music.﻿Sublime stuff, as our Lord gives us more holiness, to enable us to survive 
the Time of  Jacob's Trouble. His coming is imminent. !!!﻿i love listening to the tabernacle, i do it for hours on end What a fabulous message; so well expressed in words and deeply inspiring 
music.Haven't been there, the song itself is true, the voices are angelical.This song inspires me to become a better person. Thank you :)Tabernacle choir is wonderful... Everyone sing their heart... I was there. i felt the spirit soooo much. good stuffWhat a wonderful choir!
