oh man i love it but its playing so slow﻿The Angel pushed that stone over like it was paper!. I had to rewind it..
I think out of all of the movies I've seen this is the best interpetation 
of it..﻿Jesus is the hope of everyone﻿Jesus left at His tomb


﻿wait a minute

how many ppl were at his tomb???﻿Omg if he's dead how did he come back to life ﻿They carried His body to a disciple's tomb And wrapped Him carefully in 
clean cloth They had to leave for the Sabbath was soon And sealed up the 
sepulcher with a rock So no false claims could be made Several guards 
watched at the wall But they became sore afraid... An earthquake scattered 
them allSuddenly angels of the Lord Descended down from heaven And sat upon this 
fallen door Their watch keep to be given Mary Magdalene and one, Mary Came 
to prepare the body at dawn Instead they were given a message to carry: He 
is not here, He is risen- and lives on!Angel's thoughts while rolling away the stone: This is so unsatisfying. 
*Pushes the stone over so that it smashes into the ground.* Now THAT'S more 
like it!i love it lord.... @bookofmormonaudioGoshen Utah. The lDS church as land out there with an entire Jerusalem set. 
The land out there looks like the Middle East. Google map it. He is risen!! He lives!!who are the two angels that opened the tomb?The greatest event to ever occur in all of history. Where Christ showed 
that death is surely not the end.My Saviour, my King, never will I forget thee!Powerful! Angels unspoken words "get out of the way!" AwesomeI know that mi savior JesusChrist live!!!!!
