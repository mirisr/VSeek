very spiritual. I feel very blessed when I listen to the choir.﻿I want tis music!﻿If this is what we hear and see can we immagine the day the lord jesus 
fulfills his promiseOther Christian denominations use this hymn tune for "Come to the Savior, 
Make No Delay."I really like it when they sing. My favorite choir or even musical group.This is absolutely glorious!Love love love this hymn! And the choir sang it so beautifully!
