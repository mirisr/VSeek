You are a member of the largest family in heaven or on earth.I LOVE THIS SONG! ITS SO INSPIRING!!!I remember this song from the "Our Heavenly Father's Plan" video back in 
the 80' s. My dad discovered the Church shortly after my parents divorce at 
what could've been one of his lowest points in life. I am ever so grateful 
for his decision to be baptized. My family has been blessed so much because 
of it. I LOVE being Mormon :)I really wish these had a date on them. I remember watching a bunch of 
these in seminaryWow.Great!Wonderful,make me cryAwesome video!
