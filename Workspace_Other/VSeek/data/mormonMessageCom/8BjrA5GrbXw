"For generations the prophets have told us that we must help the 
missionaries find and teach the honest in heart and then love those who 
come into the kingdom...On most evenings and every weekend, I taught the 
gospel of Jesus Christ to people the members brought to us. Truly, the 
full-time missionaries cannot do it without the member missionaries' 
support and help!
