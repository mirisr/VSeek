Merry Christmas to all.  ﻿I cry﻿On this night, we celebrate the birth of the Savior, the Redeemer, the 
Mediator, the Son of the True and Living God, who loved the world so much 
that He gave His Son to each of us, to you and to me, so that we might live 
and love with Him and through Him.  May you bask in that love and feel of 
His peace as we remember Him on this Holy Night.  Remi and I love you.  
More importantly, He loves you.  May we love Him!﻿Felicidades a todo el mundo, recuerden que el festejado es nuestro hermano 
jesucristo, es su cumple , no el nuestro, saludos desde ixmi , hgo, mex.﻿Great Song, Great Video ... Merry Christmas from Austria!

﻿Really great video with a lovely song =)﻿Thank you Mormon Channel for a beautiful video! I love the Saviour with all 
my heart. I just love this time of the year. Merry Christmas to you all....﻿「さやかに星はきらめき」

イザヤ9:6「ひとりのみどりごがわれわれのために生れた、ひとりの男の子がわれわれに与えられた。まつりごとはその肩にあり、その名は、『霊妙なる議士、大能の神、とこしえの父、平和の君』ととなえられる。」﻿This, and other similar videos, take those who are watching them, back in 
the world's history, to that day and age, that time.  They make it seem as 
though you were right there, glimpsing a glorious part of spiritual 
history.  Though I love all Christmas music, "O Holy Night", is one of my 
favorites, I love this video! ﻿Awesome! If you're a fan of this music, you may enjoy my original music! 
Please visit my channel and let me know what you think. Hope you like!﻿I am so grateful to our Father for the gift of His Son.  ﻿We don't know for sure if those 3 guys came to visit Jesus at the same time 
together. Do we? Did the Bible say that? 😯 Just wondering.😊﻿Hermoso...y gracias!!!
﻿I can't stop thinking about this music video - it is amazing the POWER of 
music put to THESE images.   The 'fall to their knees' part just brings me 
to tears!!!!!!   Reverently POWERFUL.   Thanks again Mormon Channel.﻿Beautiful﻿wonderful praise ﻿ОН  ЛЮБИТ  МЕНЯ  и  ВСЕМ  СЕРДЦЕМ   ЗНАЮ  ЭТО  Я !  СПАСИБО  ЗА  ЭТОТ

WELL, DONE  TO THE MORMON CHANNEL.

I LOVED IT & WAS QUIET EMOTIONAL TOO!!!!

GREAT STUFF!!!

MANY THANKS!!!!﻿I agree with Nielson. The fact that the man ran up to Jesus to embrace him 
almost as if he's a child running up to his parent, which is quite true... 
It can make anyone smile. It makes me remember the days when innocence 
still reigns in many hearts. We were all once a child.﻿facebook﻿The most touching video of the Savior and His mother Mary with the most 
touching music.﻿Hellow Brothers and sisters ?? Greating you a merry merry Christmas to all﻿And they lds are not Christians my fav carol my fav video I am a Mormon and

how Jesus brought physical and spiritual peace to many, as He can today

us of what is really important.﻿Very nicely put together video :)﻿Beautiful!﻿The part that touches me the most is at the end (2:43) when the man notices 
the Savior and runs to embrace him. What a beautiful scene of compassion. I 
know that Jesus Christ is the Savior of us all. The Savior stands willing 
to accept all who will choose to come to him.﻿absolutely beautiful﻿
