Zagt nicht! Ich bin mit dir o fürchte dich nicht,
denn ich bin dein Gott du stehst vor mein’ Angesicht.
Ich stärke, und schutze und sage dir, “Stand!”
Erhoben durch meine, erhoben durch meine
durch meine aufrichtig' allmächtige Hand.﻿beautiful﻿Fear not, I am with thee,
For I am thy God.﻿who dares dislike this?She is beautiful! and the singing is just superb.this beautiful old hymn sung beautifully and with feelingthis is my favorite church hymm. its a song that just brings anyone who 
listens to it to tears.i like it better then mo tab, it somehow doesnt sound that loudBeautiful!!EU AMO TODOS OS HINOS , MAS ESSE E MUITO ESPECIAL EN MINHA VIDA , SOU GRATA 
AO PAI CELESTIAL POR TANTAS BENÇÃO QUE TEMOS.very good choir songWords are the best. They have held me up in times of trials. Thank you!!!!!Without doubt the best performance of this hymn I have ever heard. When I 
hear the closing portion of the some it seems to me that when the sisters 
sing "Fear not I am with thee" its like its being said to us by our 
Heavenly Mother and when the bretheren are singing its being said by our 
Father in Heaven. Truly touching and inspiring.@cassylee17- I could not agree more.My sister song here! She's the bright, bleach blond! You can't miss her! 
Haha 0:55 :)Absolutely brilliant!AWESOME!!!!!!!!It was great getting to hear the Combined choirs, from BYU-Idaho sing, 
especially, since my grandnephew, Jared, was singing in it! Great song! Great performance!
