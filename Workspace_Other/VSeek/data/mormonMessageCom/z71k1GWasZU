"Da Corte Celestial" in Portuguese. A beautiful hymn. The first I heard in 
the church. August 1988.﻿Who is the arrangement by?﻿This is the Holy-Hymn I will
liked to be sung during my
Funeral.﻿The rendition of this beautiful hymn is truly wonderful.   I never tire of 
listening to it.﻿Absolutely stunning. The Spirit of The Lord was with this choir that day.This version of this song sends shivers up and down my spine. Probably the 
best version I have ever heard. The Spirit of our Lord was there that day!my absolute favorite line is "his life he freely gave" especially with this 
choir. absolutely incredible performanceI turned 65 last week. I have been hearing this wonderful hymn since I was 
a teenager. The Spirit is always present in my heart and even now, after 
just listening to this presentation, tears fill my eyes. I am thankful for 
Heavenly Father's loving provision in the great plan of the Gospel made 
possible by the life, death and resurrection of our Savior Jesus Christ. To 
Him be all honor, praise and glory throughout all eternity. I so look 
forward to His promised return.Just heard this today in Sacrament less than an hour after hearing my uncle 
had passed away. I could hardly hold back. A healing song indeed.What a sound! Wow! So smooth and fresh. A beautiful blending of voices.beautiful peace mmmSo beautiful, what an absolute fabulous job these young men and women have
