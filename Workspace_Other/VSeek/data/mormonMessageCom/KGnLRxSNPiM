jacket :)@lop0150 Maybe they meant to click like and missedthat is my school, and I AM PROUD TO BE A TITAN. i wasn't there when this 
happened but it's good to know that i go to school with these people. these 
people that are willing to put aside differences to make this girl happy. @lop0150 some people just have to hate everythingsome pepole hate everything 4 no reasonThis is all great but you don't need to be religious to do good on this 
planet. how is it possible to dislike this video?thankful for the examples of the believers!People must love each other...I agree with this video is an example for us 
....THIS IS LOVEdonate for a good generationWell Miss Brittany, look at you! So wonderful. You are such an inspiration 
and what a gorgeous little doll. I love that jacket! Love your cheer squad, 
and many congratulations on your exciting homecoming queen and cheerleader 
update! Yay, Brittany! xoxo Love from me to you, Jill That is true Christlike love!as an atheist, I must say, religion can do good in the world!im atheist but this video really melted meAwesome Message! Thx for the good example Titans!I want to ask you, What is true POWER - "Brittany, you are a great example 
for me"(LDSgermanHLT-youtube) of courage, determination, and how to help 
others with the gifts you have. I think about what gifts do I have and how 
can I help others. This is true POWER -we watched this in seminary yesterday. It was very powerful and inspiring. 
I even cried when i watched it...Very touching video -- as always... They are true examples of charity of 
the Believers. Every one of these videos also have the most beautiful music 
-- where can I buy the CD with these soundtracks? Serious question.i really love this brittany you are A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE i love this....Brittany, you are a great example for me. Thank you for your beautiful 
smile and your ability to receive help. This is not easy I know. Huggs and 
Love from GermanyAs a mother of a daughter with special needs. I am tryly touched by this 
heart warming story. What wonderful girls. Thank you! The world needs more 
of you!I have a brother with mental disabilities, and it always touches my heart 
when others are kind and loving with him. I especially like the fact that 
the girls in this video took the time to get to know Brittany as a person. 
That is what charity means to me - seeing another person just like I am a 
person.The world is blessed with you in it. Never forget that! :)Few videos bring tears.Dear Cheerleaders of Syracuse High, Thank you for helping Brittanys dream 
come true you are all very special young ladies. Brittney Crocket, you are 
loved and most especially by your Heavenly Father, who will welcome you 
home. Hearing your story brought tears to my eyes. Matthew 25:40 [And the 
King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye 
have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it 
unto me.]wow! powerful!Agreed, Pilottim. What if everyone had a more Christ-like love? What if we 
would all do simple acts like the Syracuse Titans did or maybe an act as 
simple as changing the tire of a neighbor's car that's been flat for a few 
days? It is easy to get caught up in wanting to help someone spiritually 
rather than listen, be patient and come to understand their needs. The 
Titans not only made Brittany happy and more confident, but they also gave 
her a model or two or three or four to follow. :)I loved watching this video and hearing how one lady's compassionate 
comment about this girl's wish was retold over and over until it reached 
the school administrators, who made an exception for Brittany to become an 
honorary cheerleader. This is a beautiful story for one beautiful girl! D.Love it. those wonderful young women touches my heart.Awesome message and video! The music is perfect too.I have written a song, called "Sage", about being accepting of the 
handicapped. I invite you to my channel, meyersonfire, to enjoy it and 
spread it to those you love who are living with these challenges & their 
families, that they might feel inspired & encouraged to know that they are 
our heroes. Love, jjmeyers.Yes we can help other people because it is a good thing to do....but do you 
know of a lot of people who serve but not understand why they serve? It 
ties into religion because that is what mormons are all about. Not only do 
they serve but they serve with a purpose. Mormons are serviceOf course! My religion just helps me remember to do good when I sometimes 
get caught up in my selfish concerns.I love what one of the young women says here, "You have to love who you are 
around and love the gospel and you can' t be afraid to show that." So true. 
I want to be more like this.i love our cheerleaders! you hear of those snotty no good cheerleaders and 
that has not been the case at SHS i love to be a student and brittany was 
the sweetest girl in my math class... GO TITANS!!!Well done. Very inspiring and I loved the music that went with it.Beautiful example of youth at their best. These girls know what is 
important, and show real Christ-like love.A source of inspiration to us all. This is what we all must do and think of 
achieving every day: compassion and understanding of everyone.mormons are very kind ,nice and everything. I lived with them and found 
this truth. bless you.its a wonderful thing you did, although on the other hand im not sure what 
helping and religion have to do with each other... can't we just help 
people because its a good thing to do?i cried when i saw this.Thats a story that will light up you day no mater how down you are!Wow. That was one of the most Christlike examples of love that I've ever 
seen.ohh my gosh this is amzing those girls are so giving at the school there 
those people that can make a difference in the world..if the world could 
all be like them with thier belief and kindness! this is an AMaZING 
story!!!!! :) i was crying becuase of it!!! :Dthis is simply amazing......these girls are unbelievable. May God bless all 
of them. This is one of the best videos I've seen on youtube. Love you 
Titans!!!I am so proud of these girls and this story. I wish everyone could see the 
worth of every soul in this way. Love these Mormon messages...aww i was about to cry but i dident because my mascarea will smear but wow 
i though cheer leaders will bee mean but wow amazingI loved it! how wonderful : )im a boy and im 12 and i really never cry to stuff like this i only got 1 
tear but for a boy like me thats hard to get good luck brittany :):) i love this story its so sweetwhat a grate video and vary Hart Touching to all ... Thanks for bring so 
kind to other that can't do what us other have the advantage of in Life!!!!Aww, how sweet. Very kind of all of them. :)Balled like a baby! So touching. Acts of human kindness are THE most moving 
aspect of this life. This video really touched me. Very professional from 
the music to the shots. These messages are such a blessing. Thank you!pretty young woman, and preciosas mujeres, q mas bello q ver that virtuous 
woman :DThis video brought me to tears... see how an act of kindness can go a long 
way!Muy buen hecho!I admire Mormons very much.Fantastic video! A powerful message for people of all age groups. Thank 
you. Note for correction: The subtitles are out of synch starting at 3:30.How could a man alive not want to be acquainted with a "woman of virtue?" 
Aren't these young ladies just wonderful? Young Women who live their 
religion and uphold the young women values ought to be considered the 
greatest companion choice for the Millennium 2000. I happened to marry such 
a girl!Beautiful story, wonderful video! The captions were incorrect for the last 
third of the video for me, though. Weird.This young ladies show real love. Our world could be heaven.the video is so touching! I love how these young women are willing to 
accept Britteny in the team, that even she cannot support the team 
physically but spiritually always. The is a perfect example of charity and 
the love of God's children.This may be the MOST powerful 'message' in a long line of wonderful videos. 
It just feels, looks, and sounds (wonderful music) sooooo professional. And 
the MOST important thing is the spirit was felt so profoundly during all of 
it. Thanks to the church for sharing this with so many.She's a beautiful girl!Beautiful. Just absolutely beautiful.please in spanish, for my young women, thanksThe Lord loves you no matter what and there are 365 new days in every year 
to start fresh. Try not to feel depressed, those feelings don't come from 
your Heavenly Father. Try again next week, they will be happy to see you 
there.This is another beautiful video. God lives among us!Esto es el amor puro de Cristo, Muchas Gracias!!Wow. Amazing. Thank you to those girls and to the people who put this video 
together.thanks very mutch!!!!!!! Charity Never Faileth!Now THAT is true christianity. Thanks very much.
