I really love how little children say things that leave their parents 
speechless. It reminds me of this scripture, in Alma 32:21 "And now, he 
imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. 
Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many 
times, which confound the wise and the learned."﻿it's always why WHY﻿gotta give this commercial credit, i did not see that one coming. so sweetI don't understand.Why are there two dislikes?True, but very funny too.Thanks for posting these online
