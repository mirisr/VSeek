Melody the answer to doubts and skepticism is deeper knowledge. Continue to 
read the scriptures, the Bible and the Book of Mormon, and seek knowledge 
though study and by prayer.Hello Melody, if I may, I am a convert in the Church. I dont have a perfect 
knowledge of things, there are many things that if I use logic alone, 
everything will not look correct. Last sunday's lesson was about pride, 
where small issues deceived even prominent men and women of the early 
church become inactive but then came back with such great regret of falling 
away. In between agreeing and your doubting, there should be FAITH then one 
day you will have a perfect knowledge through ENDURANCE.the power and authority of an apostolic witness does not replace personal 
daily effort in growing a testimony through daily scripture study and 
prayer. This voice of truth confirms what we should try and be preparing 
and working out in our own salvation...that said...How BLESSED we are to 
live in these times where so much truth, light and teachings are available 
through Christ's authorized Priesthood authority because of the restoration 
of the Gospel in these latter-days. Thank you brethren!As a mormon - I can agree with many things here - however I also doubt - I 
have left the church and found myself back home(church) but still just dont 
feel the same as I use to..... Come to Az - the Chino Valley Church - you 
declare something - however I want to be a more of a believer and who 
better than a special witness of God to help me -
