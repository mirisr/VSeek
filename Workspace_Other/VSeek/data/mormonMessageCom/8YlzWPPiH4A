On the road to Emmaus
Two disciples spoke of Christ
They mourned the death of Jesus
Who was their hope of new life

Jesus came and walked with them
They knew not His voice or face
I am sure they, then, wept when
He vanished without a trace

For it was then that they knew
They had walked and supped with Him
Looking back... they had known, too
For their hearts had burned within﻿Oh the human mind,
We wrestle with hopes and fears.
And the Lord so kind,
When we need Him, He appears.

Then, as we seek truth
His words warm and calm the soul.
We can know what's true
For His peace helps us feel whole.﻿What a WONDERFUL experience of these deciples: To be chosen by Jesus Christ 
to talk, walk, and having Him at his house and eat with Him after his 
resurrection.
Secrets of Heavens are in front of our eyes everyday, we just have to pay 
attention to see it.﻿It is important to remember who we are, where we are and where are we 
going, so that we don't loos sight of what is important﻿
