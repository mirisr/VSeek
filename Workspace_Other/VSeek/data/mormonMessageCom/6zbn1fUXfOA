You are not useless at all. Heavenly Father chose this time in your life 
because you are ready for it NOW. Take advantage of the priceless gift you 
have been given at this stage in your life. You have a strong understanding 
of Christ's atonement and His role in your life. Share your testimony with 
others and serve others. I promise you that you will feel useful.Gracias por ser un instrumento magnifico en la obra del Padre Celestial y 
por compartirnos mensajes tan inspiradores. To Clayton Willis. ...trust your Heavenly Fathers individual plan that is 
just for you....we are never too old or useless! Remember that you are of 
infinite worth...you are a son of the most powerful being in the universe 
and you are an ETERNAL being...therefore...you will never be too OLD or 
useless and you never know who your life experiences or individual 
testimony will reach or help when others cant...we are all a part of the 
creators intricate plan and grand design ...He needs all of us!Clayton Willis your not to old until you quite. Some of the greatest people 
of all time made their greatest accomplishments in their later years. Your 
words are inspiring to those of us who are "young" to live better and do 
more now!That's not true at all! You still have the ability to share your knowledge 
of the truth with the rest of the world. Let your testimony shine as a 
beacon to everyone who reads it.You're not useless. With age comes wisdom, with wisdom comes power. Older 
folks have a tremendous power in the church for good. There are many 
opportunities to serve and share the gospel in the advanced years!I know that He is always there beside us. I'm new to the church. I wonder why our heavenly father decided to expose 
me to the church now when I'm old, and useless? I love god and I am 
grateful to Jesus for his atonement, but why now? I am no use to anyone.Gracias por su hermoso mensaje.yesThis is Great!When you walk a path strewn with thorns That's isolated and marked by 
struggle Remember blessings come in many forms And our Father is aware of 
your trouble We were not placed on this earth To walk alone, crippled in 
fear Remember you are a child of worth And our Father is always near He is always there beside you! <3 So grateful for that! We love you 
President Monson! We can know of God's love for us And that we never walk alone Pray and read 
from His scriptures, thus For that is how He makes things known
