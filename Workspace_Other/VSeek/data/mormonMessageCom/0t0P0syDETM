@jackthefrenchguy He did, as did many of the other prophets, teach 
non-violence and to love everyone. Indeed, many missionaries went to preach 
and risk their lives teaching the Lamanites who did not have the gospel. If 
you read the Book of Mormon and understand it you will see that it was not 
"God" who struck down the Nephites, rather, it was the Nephites themselves 
that led to their demise. I encourage you to read the BOM two times (that 
is how long it too me to be open to the teachings).
