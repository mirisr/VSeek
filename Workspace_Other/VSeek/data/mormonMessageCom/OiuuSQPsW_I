I wish there was lyrics﻿One of my favorite hymns!﻿Beautiful :)﻿enjoyable:)﻿Beautiful song. Always uplifts me all the time.It has so much meaning 
reminding us everyday that God will never forsake us because he is always 
reaching out for us.﻿Yes! My grandma who is not LDS used to sing that to me all the time growing 
up....then I joined the church and heard this song and thought, "Hey! What 
a friend We have in Jesus!" <3 So this song has a tender place in my heart!So angelic ... like "What a friend we have in Jesus" niceGreat new arrangement! Love it the changes in the chords leading up to 
climax at 3:35. Genius. The tabernacle choir is amazing! I always look forward to hearing them 
sing!!!
