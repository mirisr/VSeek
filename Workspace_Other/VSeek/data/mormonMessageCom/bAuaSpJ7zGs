﻿merite t'il cette souffrance prenons conscience﻿     Jesus Christ the savior of the world is at the center of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints.  
    There is no doctrine that is more important to the members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints than the Atonement of the 
Savior of the world.    
    If the gospel were compared to a wagon wheel, the Atonement of Jesus 
Christ would be the hub holding everything up; it is the life and light and 
strength of the Church.
    As the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, “The fundamental principles of 
our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning 
Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and 
ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion 
are only appendages to it” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 121).﻿LINDO!﻿Oh the thrill of knowing that, because He lives, we shall live also.I believe chronologically speaking, the book of Revelations isn't the last 
book written in the Bible. Meaning are the scriptures written after the 
Book of Revelations false because they came after? Understand that the 
Bible is a complement of books/records. Not a novel with chapters, but a 
bookshelf of God's commandments/scriptures/genealogy records and so forth. 
Besides, the Book of Mormon doesn't add to it, it's an entirely different 
set of scripture testifying of Christ alongside the Bible.And there is no problem with this. We understand that in the pre-mortal 
council with God, Satan (who was then Lucifer and a choice spirit) was cast 
out of our Father's presence for rebellion. Jesus said nothing about the 
addition of or subtraction of books of the Bible. In fact, such addition is 
exactly what was done when the "biblia" was compiled in its present form. 
Consider also that the warning in Revelation is similar to a warning in 
Deuteronomy, both protecting the revelations as given.Mormons believe that the devil and Jesus are brothers JESUS said not to add 
or subtract from the Bible What do you want to know?!Glory be to God in Jesus name. amenA hope in Christ is the only sure anchor in a world like ours.Follow the Saviour Jesus Christ. I give thanks to our Lord. He lives.i wants some one to plese helpn me undrstand this mayb in box me 
xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxojesus was and still is the best thing ever that ever happend on this earth 
i will always try to be like JesusTime is so short right now so share this entire series with everyone you 
know , and may the King of Kings , the Lord of Lords bless you and all of 
your loved ones in this end of times . in Jesus name I pray , amenProphets prophesy of God. Jesus Prophesied of His Father, and testified the 
he is the Son of God, whom Heavenly Father has sent.son of god Jesus was not a prophet he is the son of God. He did his fathers bidding 
and saved us all from our sins. I really don't care if you beleive it or 
not.AmenI don't know about killinnobs but if you want to know you will have to 
prove it for yourself, sorry, but that's how it works. God doesn't force 
anyone up the sacred mountain. I think most of the people here know Jesus 
in most of the same ways they know anyone else . The one big difference is 
that I could, in theory, hallucinate about some of the people around me, 
but His light is so much higher than anything my mind could create & 
therefore, knowing that light, I know that He is real. "For GOD loved the world,that he gave his one and only son,that who so ever 
believed in him shall not perished,but have eternal life."Jesus is the rising Sun. Literally. I can prove it.May Jesus be with youthe Savior livesAlleluiah!!!!... He has, but you have to earn it.How do you know he isn't real?the burden of proof is on the one making the claim, not the one denying it. 
you are making the claim that god is real, so you are the one who has to 
prove it. can i hear your story on how he spoke to you and how you know it was him? greatest history in humanity!...
