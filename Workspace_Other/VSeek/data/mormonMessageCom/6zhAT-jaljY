Still continuing my way through these parabels, as an atheist,  to find out 
what it is all about...
And here.. i haven't got a clue :(
Anyone care to guess what message this might hold for me?ï»¿We love the Lord on the surface
When we think of Him often
Then, to really know your purpose
Be a disciple of Him.
From the very depths of your soul
Go after the Lord's lost sheep.
Bear your heart and let your love show.
You have commitments to keep.ï»¿Beautifully done as always. Was the resurrected Lord supposed to have 
prints in his hands? ï»¿The question the Savior asks, "Do you love me?" Is one that all of us will 
answer. I hope that both my words and my actions show my love for my 
Savior.ï»¿Spread the gospel sister, Amen.ï»¿I am a child of God.ï»¿Man you guys are just awesome ðŸ™†!!!!ï»¿My passion for the Gospel and my passion for film were greatly displayed in 
this video,Our Savior is simply awesome.ï»¿Awesome!ï»¿I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!:-)ï»¿Thank youï»¿Was there music really playing in the back ground back then.... Did they 
have an iPod ?ï»¿One of the most beautiful scenes in the Bible... :)ï»¿Wow, how beautifully portrayed!    We often read these accounts in the 
scriptures too quickly , with none of the emotion and reality that was 
evident at the time they occurred.     These actors portrayed the reality 
of that moment  between Peter and Jesus.    Thank you for this new upload!ï»¿Just going to leave this video footnote here :)
The First Great Commandment - Jeffrey R. Holland - October 2012 General 
Conferenceï»¿Beautifully filmed, and very touching. Filming it outdoors rather than in a 
studio makes all the difference in the world.ï»¿Excellent as always.ï»¿Eu apascento as tuas ovelhas, Senhor!!ï»¿
