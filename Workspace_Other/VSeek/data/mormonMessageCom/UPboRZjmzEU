I can't get over the lump I continue to get in my throat each time I listen 
to this!fear not for if thou art worthy thou will be blessed.We young women are part of history in the making. . awesome. I can only imagine how happy each young women would be knowing that they 
can serve the Lord straight away instead of waiting for their 21st birthday 
to come around and face the choice of either getting married or serving a 
mission. I know that marriage is more important for the women and that 
there are couple missions, but to know that they have brought the age down 
to 19 makes it that much easier for the yw to stay worthy and to grow 
spiritually before they come back and get married to their RMHaha now you'll have to start dating people your own age!I love how he said it so nonchalantly.I love Thomas S. Monson! I'm so excited to go on my mission now :)Thank you! â™¥whens china gonna open up?!Sooooooo cooooooool!I'm 14 years old, and i'm very excited for this. Altho I'm not sure if my 
fear of it is bigger than the excitement = oSisters going on a mission at the age of 19...there it goes away my dating 
pool lol - An RMwatching this the second time still has the same effect :)This will open the doors even more to the world wide spread of the gospel.
