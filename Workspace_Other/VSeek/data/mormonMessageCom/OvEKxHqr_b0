its amazing song﻿its amazing song﻿President Monson attended a stake conference in salt lake city and it was a 
Tongan stake where they sung this obviously in Tongan. He asked what the 
song was and wondered why it isn't in the english hymns anymore but then 
asked that it be sung at the very next General conference and this is the 
result of his request. #Angelicvoices #Mormontabernaclechoir﻿Somente o Pai Celestial,para nos proporcionar momentos de tão alto enlevo 
espiritual, com este espetacular Grupo Coral﻿love hearing this in my native tongue, hymn 58 of Ngaahi Himi (Tongan Hymn)﻿thank you lord I truly am feeling better today.﻿It is also a very familiar and often-sung Samoan LDS hymn. ﻿Such a wonderful and inspiring song, blessings.﻿Great song. 
It inspired me today. It is a message from haven ﻿Is this in the English hymnbook? I know it's in the Spanish version and 
don't remember hearing it in English until today.﻿I do too. It helps them show what a great message they're trying to bring
