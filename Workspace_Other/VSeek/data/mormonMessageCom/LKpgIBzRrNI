3 Years ago i lost my right arm in a farming accident, 6 months ago i 
prayed to Jesus, in the morning when i awoke, my right arm had regrown to 
it's former glory, ..praise be to God. For he is the power and the Glory.I absolutely love this! It is a good refresher of things we should be doing 
daily our whole lives.@drewskione NopeShe speaks the truth, with a love for God. great all the best sonia&familiaGreat talk, I thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from it. She likes like she could be his daughter.
