You guys sounded just awesome, that was my favorite song sung in the 
Priesthood session, well done !! I was in the choir. I am shown at 0:18. I loved singing That hymn. The last 
verse is very powerful, and made me tear up inside because of its power in 
singing it.What a great choir of the "rising generation", how we love our beloved 
young people so much energy and power.
