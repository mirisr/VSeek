we thank thee oh God for a Prophet﻿He looks great for 84 years old.﻿I thank God my Heavenly Father for the blessing of a living prophet on the 
face of the earth in this day & time!!!   I thank God my Heavenly Father 
that He still loves His children who live on the earth now so much that He 
still speaks to us as He did to His children who lived in ancient days!  In 
the sacred name of my Lord, Saviour & Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ! 
 Amen!﻿How can a video with 33,514 views only have two comments?!?﻿
