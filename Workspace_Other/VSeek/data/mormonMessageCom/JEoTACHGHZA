Kent F. Richards - The Atonement Covers All Pain I like Elder Richards 
teaching that pain teaches us patience and that it also gives us 
understanding. He said, "it is through sorrow and suffering that we get the 
education we came here for." Equally interesting is the insight that Christ 
chose to undergo pain and afflictions to better understand us (Alma 7: 12).he was my mission president. very wise man.
