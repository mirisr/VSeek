Before we can learn about the lessons we first have to learn about the 
people, not just as a group but as individuals in thier own right.When I give class, I often receive the feedback that it was a great 
lesson... The class was engaged and I felt more like a facilitator making 
sure we stayed within the outline of the lesson. But I was often a bit hard 
on myself and not really receiving the positive feedback because the lesson 
didn't seem as structured as other experienced Sunday school teachers 
usually had them (enhanced Primary lessons with reading slips). Now I get 
it, they really meant it :)
