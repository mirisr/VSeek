I wish I could give two thumbs-up.Precious!!I love this! So cute! And the kids are right! (we still don't know if it's 
up) <3Kids aren't given enough credit. We grown-ups do have a tendency to 
complicate things. Matthew 21:16, 3 Nephi 26:16These children are amazing! In those simple little answers they gave, they 
show some of the best understanding of the purpose of life that this world 
has ever seen, and such sincere faith, too.wow......awesome parents/amazing babies :) thankyou for adding to the 
spirit of the sabbath.So, Cute (: "It's not so comlicated you just have to ask a kid!" So, Cute (: Oh my GOODNESS!! See why Primary is the best calling in the church?!! We 
have fun AND learn the gospel--at the same time!Very cute.
