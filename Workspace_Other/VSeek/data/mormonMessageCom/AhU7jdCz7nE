we shouldn't hate but love are enemies and pray for themThe service missionaries in our ward are SUCH a blessing to our ward, and 
SUCH a huge help to the Bishop. God bless those who give this service! The 
missionaries love this service opportunity. Our missionaries always try to 
extend their service time. Sometimes, they try (and usually fail) to get 
permission to stay in our ward because they come to truly love those with 
whom they work. It is a wonderful opportunity that blesses all involved. My 
husband and I can't wait to have this opportunity!Beautiful message!!so much truth......so few ears. I love this. Thank you so much for sharing this program through this video. so wonderful. I love videos like this. :)Beautiful! Pure awesome.Edificante *-*
