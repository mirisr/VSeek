Thank you so much. God bless you men. You teach with such clarity.ï»¿I like the distinction between personal communication with God and the 
Priesthood line in which priesthood leaders give direction for the church 
as a whole. This is a great quote: "Those who reject the need for organized 
religion reject the work of the Master, who established His Church and its 
officers." Clearly Christ established organized religion in His day (see 
Ephesians 4:12-13). The parallel to Jethro and Moses is equally 
illuminating. Priesthood leaders should learn to delegate.
