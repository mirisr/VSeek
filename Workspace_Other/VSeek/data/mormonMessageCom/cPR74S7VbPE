thanks for the uploadI love the concept presented in this video; whenever I have a personal 
challenge, especially as it pertains to becoming more qualified for eternal 
life, I often try to remind myself, "I don't have to do this by myself---in 
fact, I can't do this by myself. That is why I have a partnership with the 
Lord."
