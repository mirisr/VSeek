GREAT SONG THANKS PRAISE THE LORD﻿who's the arranger of this piece?﻿this is the geographer/mariner's hymn and the Mariners are one of my 
favorite baseball teams, them and the Orioles. There's no hymn for Orioles, 
unless it's All Creatures of Our God and King :)﻿Learned this at school.﻿oh I love this hymn, it touches my heart I had no idea this was a song, I saw a poster at a truck stop long ago and 
have done my own version of it at my church on acoustic guitar ever 
since...I thought I made it up!!..well, I did, I guess, but a different 
song with the same title...in fact, I prefer my version as it is less 
dramatic and far less forboding...but this is a beautiful choir...god bless 
everyone!!!I was bourn with this hymn sung around me and still is the same to this 
day.Well done choirone of my favourite hymns!
