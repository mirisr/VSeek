I love Jesus. Hail Jesus Christ! :)﻿The actor to play as Jesus was a great choice and the soundtrack was genius 
, it definitely fits in with the miracle that occurs.﻿Thank you! For everything that you've done for me and my family and friends 
❤️﻿we are all brothers and sisters in all time﻿Jesus is God , a true loving God﻿Oh and I meant Jesus not jess﻿Who ever disliked r very very wrong even if there not Christian but Jess in 
the past was brought here to help people so if people disliked it because 
they think it's fake well its not there was a boy in my sixth grade class 
he is blind and I hope that today the same thing happens as this man﻿Jesus is our true Lord,that drives us away from sin.﻿I really love this scene so touching. I'd really like to know the name of 
the music composition when the blind man was bathing in the water. Is there 
no soundtrack ?﻿when i watch these videos i tear up i love you my lord may we all find 
favour with jesus﻿my lord you truly are the light i am nothing compared to you but you make 
me so my lord i worship and love you﻿👍﻿04:20 He is a Prophet.....﻿what is the name of this song?﻿sad video﻿Powerful.﻿I love these videos...so comforting, the moment He guided the blind man to 
the pool, the same way He guides us today, so lovely. God bless everyone﻿Lord ,I bless your name﻿Lord ,I bless your name﻿Lord ,I bless your name﻿Lord ,I bless your name﻿Jesus please bless my family and me pls﻿What is the title of this movie? ﻿When I'm watching this video,a tear came out of my eyes, I just love you my 
father..﻿0:30-0:45--As someone who has been visually impaired since birth, this 
dialogue between Jesus and the disciples gives me great joy. The man was 
born blind so God's work could be seen through him. I love it. So often 
disability is seen as a bad thing and it doesn't have to be. Personally I 
like to think that, in place of whatever physical or mental capabilities 
people with disabilities lack, God gives us unique bits of wisdom to share 
that we might not have had with all our earthly senses.﻿what movie﻿what is the movie?﻿Jesus, Moses and Mohammed Are the best!
I'm a Muslim and we love all three of those prophets! 😄﻿Vanessa, my wife almost passed out on the road while driving to a 
graduation this weekend and so after watching this and reading your entry I 
broke down and knew the hand of God was on my wife that day. it was a 
miracle.﻿Dont see the face..close your eyes and listen to words﻿My wife had heart failure at the age of 24 the power of the prayer to let 
Jesus hear us healed her he is among us just pay attention as he guides you 
﻿I know He loves us, He is the Son of The Living God! ﻿I know for lots of people God is hard to believe but one day, you will 
understand ﻿I loved Jesus so much that I cry and pray for him and he is awesome ! Than 
you Jesus 🙏🙏🙏﻿Beautiful ❤️﻿beautiful, awesome story.﻿Man that's a lesson learned﻿You know that you sin but you are sometimes confuse what is inside your 
mind and feeling, you cannot say it is insanity, if you cant help your own 
problem , getting tired to think, and you cry hard, the last is you call 
him i am sure he will answer, you feel shame and become humble to him jesus 
as son of god, his humbleness in earth is the same in his kingdom in 
heaven...﻿This is my life experience; Secrets of Heaven and miracles are in front of 
our eyes everyday. we just have to pay attention and we will see them. I 
believe in Jesus Christ because I cannot deny all work He have done, His 
doctrine, His teachings and His example and His wisdom that did change the 
course of all mankind.﻿I wish Jesus made my mum and dad see because there blind aswell

﻿such a beautiful video!!!﻿What a good story﻿Jesus still heals today. God has done miracles in my life. Check out my 
video "Walk By Faith."﻿Thank you Lord Jesus for opening our eyes. "the eyes of the blind ones will 
be opened." Isaiah 35:5 fulfilled promise﻿Just saw this Andy. It was wonderful! All of these videos are.﻿Thank you Lord﻿This is a link to a video of a beautiful Neapolitan Nativity Scene. Merry 
Christmas to all of you!
