This is the religion that shouts aloud to Native Americans: "We know you, 
We know that Sweet Medicine was here. We know you had empires and wars, 
even if the rest of the White Men say it didn't happen. We know you had 
writing and lost it." Why every Native American doesn't see it is beyond 
me. I am 1/32nd Cherokee and fixing to join up real soon. Because you 
acknowledge Cahokia Empire and there's even a great painting that 
commemorates Jesus (Sweet Medicine) at what I know to be Cahokia. I love this. She WANTED to join the Church. She was ready and she saw the 
light in certain LDS people who truly live the gospel (not just 
culturally). I love it. Thank you for sharing, Karen!
