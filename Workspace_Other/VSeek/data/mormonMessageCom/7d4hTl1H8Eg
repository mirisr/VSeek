Warm felt talk....Bro don't judge us till the next life #HARTERS GONNA HATEVery beautiful talk. It has touched my heart.You cannot love your family more than God.Not all sisters in Relief Society do their job that is detrimental to their 
spirituality. True happines is serving with all you heart.All we lern is taken with us beyond the veil.Perfection in leaving harming situations that deter or spirituality is a 
must. Heavenly father wants women to abide by Proverbs 31/10. No being lazy 
and indifirent nor doing more than you can handle. Looking after a family 
that you can do special things for. Indiference is no acceptable nor nice.
