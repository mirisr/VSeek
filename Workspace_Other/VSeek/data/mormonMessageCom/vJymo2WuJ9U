I did this for general conference. Instead of recording things the speakers 
said, I recorded promptings I got from the Spirit. Creating my own small 
plates is a great idea! Great advice Elder Bednar! :) Thanks for posting 
this.There is no doubt that this man is an apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ
