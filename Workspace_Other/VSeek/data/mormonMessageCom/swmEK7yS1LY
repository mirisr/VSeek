Welcome home Elder Wickman, thank you for your service to our country.Uploading over 20 videos at 1 time? Are any of you actual YouTube users 
yourself? If so, you should know how obnoxious it is to have your 
subscription queue monopolized by a channel that went upload crazy. What 
makes it worse is that the videos you're dominating my queue with, the 
Wickmans, are the most boring videos posted by the channel. Notice how many 
of them don't have any views? I'll re-subscribe when you guys hire someone 
that's taken YouTube 101.I would love to know what he thinks about the fact that he was lied to to 
go to war.i love being mormon!
