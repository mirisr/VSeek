once Nephi and his family arrived in America things were peaceful until 
Father Lehi died. Laman and Lemuel left the family and tore their clothing 
and put on loin cloths then they put on war paint and the Lord changed 
their skin pigment they and their family became the evil Lamanites. Nephi 
names his followers the the loving Nephites and they prosper until the time 
of Jacob.ï»¿Didn't the mapping of the human genome prove that the Native Americans are
