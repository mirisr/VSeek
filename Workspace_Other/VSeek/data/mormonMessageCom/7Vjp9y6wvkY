beautiful!ï»¿love love this arrangement!! ðŸ’™ This song has helped me through some of my 
trials.ï»¿thanks for sharing your talents.:)ï»¿Jenny was gracious enough to perform for our arts council a couple of years 
ago and we found her to be just as lovely in spirit as she appears in all 
her videos.  It's wonderful to see how she and Matt have nurtured their 
children and exposed them to music.      This video is a real blessing to 
me today--I have been weighed down  by so many reports of the terrible 
things that are being done to children,  most of it by people who are 
supposed to be their parents.   It's my hope that God will use this music 
and video to inspire more love and health care for our children.     Thank 
you, Jenny, for  sharing  your family's talent with us.ï»¿This was beautifully done!  We love you guys!ï»¿beautiful musicï»¿This makes me want to be with my family so bad.

the salvation of all mankind. And this (The Church of Jesus Christ of
