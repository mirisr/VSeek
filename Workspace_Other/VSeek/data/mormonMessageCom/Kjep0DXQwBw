Alma's first trial was the Trial of Nehor. Nehor was a false prophet he 
went around preaching Sherem's garbage. Gideon was sent to arrest him but 
Nehor resisted arrest. He stabbed Gideon and killed him Gideon's deputies 
then arrested Nehor and took him to Alma. Alma asked Nehor why he was 
preaching Sherem's material and Nehor tried to worm his way out of it. Alma 
knew he could not try him for false doctrine but he could try him for 
murder. Nehor was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. that was 
not end of false doctrine in Zerahemla before he died Nehor elected Amlici 
to succeed him. in Chapter 21 we will see how Alma dealt with that.      ï»¿
