wow..just beautiful﻿i really love this video. I'm from Ghana too﻿Lovely...the Spirit whispers. Thank you.Amen to that! God bless those young souls who have finally opened their 
eyes and have decided to grow closer to God.. God definitely loves you two 
and is proud of you! :)Two beautiful shining lights. What a different place this world would be if 
every soul carried the same conviction and purpose as these two. The gospel 
of Jesus Christ will change the world.I now know where i want to serve , these people teach me to have more 
gratitude & remind me of my blessings & standards! I want to serve in 
Africa to share my knowledge & testimony to these beautiful children of god

world striving to be like Christ. I love this gospel and I love being a 
member! Such a powerful testimony!!!!This is So beautiful <3 First view first comment! cool. great message!
