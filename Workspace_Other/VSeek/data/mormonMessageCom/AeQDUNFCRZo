Perfect, like I imagine heavenly choirs.Very Inspiring!Love these messages!I sat next to someone who sung in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir on an 
airplane ride, and she was incredible snobby, and was rude when told her 
how impressed with the fact that I can't make it because I am tone deaf. I 
am a Latter Day Saint and I believe that Utah mormons are just plain mean. 
Everyone of us is the same, and everyone of us is a CHILD OF GOD. BUT there 
is NO REASON to be RUDE to each other. I want to sing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir one day when I'm older and 
the children are grown. How amazing of an experience that would be!thats coolThank you, for sharing your feelings, about the Choir's Tour! ShirleyI was there!! The show was amazing, the choir was fantastic. :)I heard that parts of their 2012 tour is already sold out.
