Interesting.I have received with certainty a testimony of Joseph Smith. It was 31 years 
ago. It was a special experience for me. He was, and is a prophet of God. 
My testimony cannot be written off as a "feeling" for feelings alone will 
never replicate a sure witness from God. I talk to a lot of people Joseph 
Smith and they refuse to test the Lord to see if he will give them the same 
witness. It's a sad thing but also a sign of the times. I thank God 
everyday for the blessings of his gospel in my life. So Cool
