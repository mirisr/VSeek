Great help,thank you...I am looking for an audio version of the Scriptures 
in German and Russian? I am currently using Android but am planning to 
change to Apple, but the there is only mp3 version of the scriptures in 
English and Spanish. Where can I find them in audio in German and possibly 
in Russian? Any help would be appreciated.ï»¿I love the Gospel Library App. I just converted. Although there was no 
audio for the Book of Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price!! Does the Android Version have the audio play feature?I love it.... on AndroidI love the Android appPlease, create all the same tools which are on Apple app for Android too, 
such as the linking. I used to have an iPod, but now I use LDS Library on 
my Android phone.Glad to see this informational video produced. I've been using the Gospel 
Library app for a while but it wasn't till about a month ago I realized how 
to capitalize on it's many features. How wonderful it is to copy & paste 
C.S. Lewis, General Conference, etc. quotes as notes to scriptures on 
LDS.org & then have them on the go via my smartphone. Mormon's & 
non-Mormons alike can really enjoy these features.Does anybody know when the andriod operating system will be able to use 
tags and links?
