Very clear explanation, but I wish he would give more personal experience 
of how he gained his own testimony or Something of his own life. He was my 
BYU pres but I feel like we hardly got to know him at all. Probably a good 
administrator though.ï»¿Samuelson speaks the truth, by experience I confirm it.I admire him greatly. He is the president of BYU-my school! :) He is a man 
of God and I'm glad that he is apart of the LDS church :)
