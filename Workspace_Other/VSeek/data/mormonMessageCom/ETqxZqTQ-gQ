@MakinYouBad After repentance "He will remember your sins no more"..Good 
thing for many of us. I, too have a past, but came back to church recently. 
What a feeling to be relived of the burden, no?I can feel the Spirit testifying of these things =Dthank you president Monson you rock!This video should have 12 million views as soon as it gets posted! :) I 
LOVE being able to watch conference in 1080p thankyou!I love that man. I know my name is bad. I carry it from my past. However, I 
am a convert, who loves our Prophet, Loves our God, and Loves our Savior. I 
will tell it, share it, and testify of it, to ANYONE who asks. I love 
seeing the light of God shine through President Monson. It warms my heart 
and it testifies to ME, through the joy of the Holy Ghost, I feel inside of 
me, that his voice is true, his words are true, and this Church is true. I 
will testify of this forever. Amen!
