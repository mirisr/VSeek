It blessed me.﻿This hymn is the fervent cry of every believer in Jesus Christ. I am 
grateful that we have the knowledge of Christ's atonement upon the Earth 
again.﻿Sounds like Heaven.  Not that I know what Heaven sounds like.﻿SPETTACOLARE M.:F.:﻿Like Angles that sing to perfections,so are they just sweet and beautifully 
sung as the heart is in tune with the saviors words a song of the heart is 
a pray unto me.god bless you'sSo beautifully done. The sopranoes never over shadow the rest of the choir. 
It is balanced and heavenly... Perfection... Never has it been performed and broadcast more beautifully. 
Thank you. I felt the power of the Spirit most abundantly.One of the most beautiful and powerful songs, performed by an amazing 
choir. Perfect ♥I usually have to hear a hymn a few times to get attached to it. The first 
time I heard this hymn was when I attended Conference many years ago. I 
loved this from the first I heard it. It is such a powerful song. Sometimes, the word 'uplifting' has to be sung. But every time this choir 
sings, it is uplifting. BeautifulThis song was so awesome to hear during conference. (:Marvelous and overwhelming performance from this Charles Gounod masterpieceThank you for singing this today. It was absolutely beautiful, and touched 
my heart.
