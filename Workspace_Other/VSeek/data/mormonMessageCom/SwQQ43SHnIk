"A shaft in the quiver of the Almighty." I love that phrase!May I recommend "The Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith" compiled by the 
prophet Joseph Fielding Smith. It is THE collection of sermons and writings 
by the prophet, organized chronologically and topically so that the 
doctrinal teachings just flow into one another. Joseph Fielding Smith also 
adds his insight as a prophet of the Lord in various footnotes. If you want 
to know Brother Joseph, this book is indespensible.I need to study the life and words of Joseph Smith.I love these videos!! Thank you for sharing. Really appreciate it.You know, my aunt gave me a Deseret Book gift card. For the longest while, 
I had no idea what to do with it. I now know exactly what I'll spend it on.
