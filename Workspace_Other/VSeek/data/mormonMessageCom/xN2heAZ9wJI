It's still used for stake conferences, concerts, and baptisms. Our stake's 
Family History Center is also in the basement of the building. I love the 
Spirit that I feel there.When I'm there for Stake conference I make sure to sit in the highest row 
possible.... Far left or right. :) Just thought you'd all like to know.... Still in use for sure!!! We have the blessing of enjoying all kinds of 
events in this beautiful building. Firesides, youth events, cantatas and 
even the Opera Company take place for our amusement and education. I myself 
have had the blessing of being part of youth choirs. Some of the greatest 
memories of my life! This place is filled with the Lord's Spirit and when 
you sing or hear others sing, it seems as if angels were singing... You 
should take a vacation and come to experience this place :)yes, it is still being used. i'm not sure about sunday services, but i 
attended a baptismal service there and when i was there around christmas 
they had a concert almost every day or so. for a stake conference it's too 
small.
