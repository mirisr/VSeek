Skeptics and non-believers will listen and think "it was just a 
coincidence". People of faith will nod and think "Yes. Something similar 
happened to me" (or to someone they know). Could it be coincidence? 
Certainly. Could it be the tender mercy of a loving Father? Definitely. The 
only thing that changes how we think about it is our attitude. And our 
attitude, while important to us individually, really has nothing to do with 
the event. It happened, and the vital thing is our response to it.
