with a pure heart, we receive the promised blessings of the Lord" (pg. 
137). Depending on the sin you have committed, you may need to abstain from 
taking the sacrament on the counsel of your church leaders. This abstaining 
shows remorse to the Lord and gives you a chance to realize how important 
the sacrament is - how much you want and need to partake of it. You will be 
able to partake of it again eventually. I hope this helps?I'm not any doctrinal giant, but I can share with you my thoughts on the 
sacrament. I'm teaching a Gospel Principles class for my ward, and if you 
check out lesson 23, you can learn more about the sacrament. It has a 
little part toward the end that says, "WE do not need to be perfect before 
partaking of the sacrament, but we must have the spirit of repentance in 
our hearts. The attitude with which we partake of the sacrament influences 
our experience with it. If we partake of the sacramentI'm so confused. I've been a member of the church all my life, yet it is up 
to this point where I feel I haven't been connected to the Holy Ghost. I'm 
questioning things I've never questioned before and I'm scared that I'll 
lose sight of the church. Really scared. I've been going video after video 
to try and learn about the most important part, the sacrament. We take the 
sacrament to renew forgiveness. But we can't take it if we've sinned and 
are unworthy and in need of forgiveness? *sigh* Idk..
