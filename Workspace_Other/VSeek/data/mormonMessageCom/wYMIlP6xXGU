I love this hymn. I've been a member for over a year now. <3﻿Harmonia linda calma e serena,(Espetacular) Deus os Abençoe cada vez mais!﻿I feel the spirit greatly every time that i listen this hym;i remember my 
mission.﻿my baptism song, I live it love it even when my path is dark and now my 
heart be broken, I shall carry your light where ad when you ask dear lord﻿The hymn has the theme of   "Eternal father , strong to save".Amazing 
chorus & flow...﻿I have the most important part in my life 💝my auntie Georgia Marie Bear 
Cloud im askingfor prayers on her behalf she had a heart attack Tuesday and 
is in ICU fighting for her life. I lknowMy Heavenly Father and his Angeles 
are with her. PRAY FOR HER TO RECOVER AND BE WITH US TALKING LAUGHING. 
Thank you in the name of Jesus Christ she'll recover. AMEN.﻿A few months ago I was called to serve my mission in Las Vegas. Several of 
my friends have had the more luxurious missions, such as to Brazil or 
Germany. Yet when I read my calling to Las Vegas, I could feel nothing but 
happiness in knowing that I was going somewhere where I was needed. This 
song has always been one of my favorites, and it's only really now that I 
understand it's meanings.Though it may not be over mountains high, or cross 
the stormy sea, but I shall go where the Lord has need of me.﻿This puts a smile on my face. ﻿Does anyone happen to know who wrote this arrangement and if the sheet 
music can be purchased?﻿I love this hymn which always brings tears to my eyes. I will go where you
