I've had many instances where people ask questions about the Church, simply 
because they want to pick out as much fault in my answers as they can.ï»¿"Make it a conversation and not a monologue" :) I like that! Don't turn the 
fire-hose on people who only want a drop/sprinkle. Thanks :)thats my experience as well. whenever someone asks me something its like i 
want to share all that i know but they dont truly want to know about the 
faith. its so dicouraging that i dont want to even engage in that 
conversationI love this man, thank you!
