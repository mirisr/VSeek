I love you Brother JosephWhat a privilege to see Karen Davidson in this video - author of some of 
our most beautiful LDS hymns. Thank you Karen!At the risk of sounding reasonable, why were there no other witnesses to 
Joseph Smith's alleged visions? Why would I be so naive to believe that any 
of them actually happened? I am not trying to be disrespectful guys, but at 
least in traditional Christianity you had witnesses other than one guy... Thank you Joseph for all your sacrifices! Thank you Pioneers for your 
contribution to the growth of the Church. I am Russian and I am a Mormon!im proud to be a mormon (:I love you brother JosephWhoa, that's really cool, I don't think I knew that before!the doubts and concerns of a Prophet are answered by the Lord.Wow. I didn't know this story.
