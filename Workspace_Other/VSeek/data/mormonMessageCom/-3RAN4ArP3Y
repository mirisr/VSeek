I think women are formed the way they are because without them men would be 
too hard, and that its primarily man's job to be hard. What I mean is that 
while I know that women could be tough & strong like Amazons, men are here 
to make it so they don't have to be rough and tough. Women can be gentle 
because men shield them from the roughness. Doing so allows men to see the 
tenderness of women, & we can then learn to emmulate it. Women can emulate 
our toughness, so we balance & compliment eachotherAmen.
