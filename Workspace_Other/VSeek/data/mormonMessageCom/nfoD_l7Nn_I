I was travelling on 15 close to Saint George early one morning . The 
mountains looked so formidable,this hymn came to mind.Love this one! I'm a bit of an Old Testament fan, and so this makes me 
think of all the righteous Jews going to battle all those times, not to 
mention how much we go through as Latter Day Saints. I also hope I can nab 
a CD of this someday!This is my FAVORITE hymn. It's both powerful and uplifting. I get a 
tremendous amount of courage from it, for my daily struggles. It is indeed 
an inspired song.I hope to hear this choir sing again in October conference. Did the choir 
release a CD with this fabulous music?Absolutely stunning, powerful, and inspirational!A song of gratitude.i am so going to ask the priesthood in my ward sing this, it is so happy 
and powerful. Love it!It is well.
