No, you're not the only woman! It was the same thing with me. 11 years old, 
I started looking online and it spiraled out of control so badly. I always 
felt like a freak too and when I tried to find help, everything was geared 
toward men and that made me feel more alone as well. Pornography addiction 
is a horrible thing facing this generation more than any other, because 
it's free, and extremely accessible. Thank you for your courage <3﻿What strength to speak up about a very powerful and real struggle. Thank 
you!﻿How  old was she when she was addicted!  When did she get the help to 
overcome this!  Wow!  brave girl!﻿This is such a needed discussion. There are so many misconceptions about 
pornography. There is a book written by an LDS man which describes exactly 
what goes on in the brain of someone struggling with it. He has been 
through it for years and tells about how it takes more than faith, hope, 
prayers, scriptures and will power. The book is called Sitting in a Rowboat 
throwing Marbles at a Battleship, by Andrew P. This is one of the books 
that professionals have the addicts read. Another great book is Out Of The 
Shadows by Patrick J Carnes, PhD. They also need the 12 step program , 
which is like AA but it is SA . They need to be attending meetings at least 
once a week. They will get a mentor (who has been through it) to check on 
them daily. It takes an addict to cure an addict. (the book says) Andrew 
likens being an addict to having diabetes. The wife wouldn't say "If you 
loved the kids and I enough you would give up your diabetes". Some people 
wonder what is wrong with them because they have repented and been through 
al the steps with the bishop but then it always comes back to haunt 
them.They think they aren't righteous enough, or didn't pray hard enough or 
read enough scriptures. It isn't a matter of will power. They might stay 
away from it for years and then it creeps back in. This is why they need 
the 12 step program. Then along with this ,and prayer and faith and the 
atonement they can be sober for the rest of their lives.﻿Thank you. You're such an example! ^_^﻿Thank you for your courage and faith. When I contemplate that the Savior of 
the "world" is also my Savior and your Savior and that He saves the world 
one person at a time, without reservation, I am filled with gratitude and 
humility.﻿efy helps ALOT﻿This girl is awesome! Such a cool story. ﻿I appreciate that this particular story is being told by a woman. I think 
when it comes to pornography people tend to assume that it's an issue among 
guys, which is untrue. I have struggled for many years with pornography and 
although I have repented I always end up going back to it. I feel 
embarrassed, ashamed, guilty, and unworthy of God's love. I know these are 
all feeling brought upon by the devil, but it is so hard to resist 
temptation. Pornography led me in to depression as a pre teen, and made me 
doubt the teachings of our church and even of God. I want to stop. I need 
to stop. Everyday is a battle for people struggling with this sin. ﻿What a brave and inspiring women :) thanks for turning this into a positive 
thing for others. I think its time for Elizabeth to feel proud of her good 
choices like this one. ﻿Im a witness that pornography addiction is by far the hardest thing ive 
ever dealt with and I too have repented many a nights after looking at it i 
felt so ashamed like everyone would judge me. Ive been praying daily that 
god takes this out of my life because its seems like it wont go away but I 
trust god and with him I can fo all things through christ that strengthens 
me. I advise anyone whos just being curious about it dont do it its a very 
powerful addiction that you're going to wish you never started ﻿I, too, struggle with pornography addiction. I messed up last night and I'm 
so ashamed. I'm glad this video is here to help me. The scariest part of 
repentance, for me, is confessing to my bishop. I'm so scared that he'll 
judge me but I have to do it in order to properly heal. Thank you for this 
video.﻿Thanks, Elizabeth, for your candid testimony and experience. My heart ached 
-- especially as a mother -- listening to your story. I'm so grateful you 
were able to find peace. May you continue to do so and to inspire those 
around you to do the same.﻿Brave to puting yourself outthere, there are a lot of women suffering from 
porn addiction, but it's so much shame in the way of seeking help. I"ve 
been treating sex addiction for almost ten years, having groups for both 
women and men. Most people can not quit by solely by faith. I just want to 
write this to people who read this and feel bad if they cant stop acting 
out by prayer. 

But i dont doubt your story for à second. There is a great power in prayer 
and belief.

All the best and blessings from Sweden,
Andreas﻿Thank you so much for sharing your story, Elizabeth. You are so strong and 
inspirational.﻿Something for me that i had to learn how to do to beat my pornography 
addiction, was to learn to automatically remove any thought once it entered 
my mind immediately and not dwell on it. One of the ways I've learned to do 
that is to command satan to get thee hence once any thought enters my mind. 
I hope this insight into my own addiction can help some of you power 
through yours. It is possible, and there may be relapses, but no matter 
what, God and Jesus Christ will always love you unconditionally as will I.﻿I been somewhat through the same thing﻿Of course girls like pornography to the point where some would get 
addicted, otherwise why would they participate in its production? Women 
have a sexuality, they have desires, and so the enemy seeks to over 
stimulate those urges in everybody regardless of gender.

We should never assume that just because guys are more vocal about 
pornography that girls are not viewing it, because by doing so, we are 
eliminating their chances of getting the help they need.

It's like assuming that skinny people don't get hungry.﻿Muito bom..nos mostra tudo aquilo que o Senhor desejo que os filhos possam 
se achegar a Ele...﻿I was once struggling with an addiction for pornography, and I thought it 
was the end of the world. I was introduced to porn on accident by ads and 
other things around 8 or 9, I didn't like it at all and couldn't look at 
it, but around 11 I (same as Elizabeth) was curious. I started to just look 
at pictures of porn, then videos. over time, I knew it was an addiction. 
But I didn't honestly know what it could do to you. 
Over time, I watched a lot more, and as soon as I got in bed at night, got 
out my iPod to watch it, then after a while, it was as soon as I got home 
from school. I remember my parents getting mad at me more often, I just 
didn't notice it was because I was changing. When it hit me that I was 
becoming angry and sad a lot more often, I knew it needed to stop. So I 
repented and asked for help... But soon was dragged back into watching 
pornography. Just about a week before I turned 12, I got extremely 
freighted. I knew that we had to be clear of the worst to go into the 
temple. I knew I had to somehow stop forever. And this time, never go back! 
I was praying hard about it, then a friend magazine came out. It told about 
a boy who saw porn and had to tell his parents. I had always said I would 
never tell anyone because it was embarrassing! But One night, I went and 
told my mom. I didn't really feel support though. She just told me it was 
bad and I could get a blessing. I did feel support soon enough. And then we 
had a class on porn and how bad it actually is and what it can do to you. 
My friend later said, "who ever watches porn is really bad and gross" she 
was my best friend, and I was heart broken. That's what really lead me to 
start to stop. I soon read my Book of Mormon every day and prayed often 
and, eventually found hope, and stopped! Now I have a testimony in our 
church stronger that the ever before! Any thing is possible through the 
lord!❤️﻿hello Elizabeth, if you are watching this video, I want to let you know 
that you are one of the most courageous people in the world. Thank you for 
sharing your experience with us all. We are all proud of you and your 
success. May God continue to bless you and your fine family. Much love from 
a sister in the Gospel.....﻿I believe that as people talk about it and teach it becomes easier for 
others facing the same to receive help....I'm grateful for the gospel. This 
sister has touched my heart.To think she had to deal with such a change at 
a young age .This is real hey
﻿I also started watching pornography when I was 9 and I'll be 18 in June 
this year. It feels despairing to know that I've been addicted almost half 
of my life so far. It often feels like the other challenges in life I have 
get worse as times goes on and my addiction continues. Getting back up and 
trying again usually every few days, only to stumble is painful and 
exhausting. 
I wish and hope that I can one day help others be free from the tormenting 
addiction of pornography. I also find comfort and peace in our Savior, 
Jesus Christ who can help me bear this burden.﻿i dont do porn but i sometimes see bad things on youtube and when i find a 
good channel i subscribe so i can watch something appropriate i have to 
watch something sometime. This video really makes me feel sorry for those 
addicted. And it helps me to stay way away and if i see bad things i just 
turn my computer off or exit that windoe :D thanks guys for helping me NOT 
get started. ﻿Thank you so much for sharing. Your courage is inspiring to me! Keep up the 
good work!﻿With the atonement, we can conquer all things. Thank you Elizabeth, for 
strengthening my testimony. ﻿📖📯☺👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍﻿Thank you, Mormon Channel.  This is my absolute favourite series on this 
channel.  Thank you for making videos that show such raw and relatable 
experiences.  I love how this video also shows that pornography is not a 
gender-specific addiction.﻿Mosiah 7:33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and 
put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do 
this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of 
bondage.﻿Wow!﻿Thanks, Elizabeth, for your courage, and your testimony.  I love how you 
said that addiction knows no bounds...but Christ and his saving grace also 
know no bounds.﻿Thank you for sharing your story. I love what you said that addiction knows 
no bounds but Christ and his saving grace also know no bounds... Keep going 
Mormon Channel and crew, there are many out there who appreciate the work 
and effort you put into producing these videos!﻿Still struggling ﻿Thank you, you are brave. You will help others. God bless you...﻿His grace is perfect and my life is better thanks for his﻿Thank you so much for creating a video to show that this isn't a gender 
specific problem. It's so hard for those girls who struggle with this to 
realize that they aren't worse than other girls because this is assumed to 
be a "man's problem". I can only imagine the amount of hope this has given 
countless girls and women. ﻿Elizabeth, thanks so much for sharing your story.  I know it must have been 
a very difficult decision to do so.  But I am so grateful you were willing 
to.  I feel like Satan's tactics of secrecy and shame are as harmful to the 
spirit as the pornography.  I think more people will be able to get help 
and support when more people are willing to be open about their struggles. 
 So many are struggling in silence and feel like they are the only one. 
 Thanks again.  I love this series "His Grace".﻿Thanks for sharing your story﻿I read the following from a book
about a man who had a vision
and was shown a few things from the unseen world.

I know.. some will not believe it..
but the images left in the mind
could be a help to someone.  
I realize it is a bit long
but well worth the read.
Here is part of his vision:

"I knew that my body was dead according to the worldly measurement,
but I was so thrilled with what I had just experienced
that I wanted to wake up my wife and tell her everything I had just learned.
Without verbal language,
my guide told me that if I wanted to talk to my wife,
I would need to go back into my body,
and this experience would be completed.

I realized there was more he wanted to show me
and that it was not time to return to my body,
but for some reason we needed to visit it—
perhaps to keep the link between my spirit and body strong
while he took me on further journeys in the spirit.
I told him, “If you have more to show me, let us go; I’m ready!”


We didn’t walk out the door;
I just found myself in a different place.
We were in a small home office.
It was late at night.
A young man in his underwear came into the room quietly,
looking around him stealthily as he entered.
He closed the door softly without turning on the light.
He went to a computer and turned it on.
As he waited for the computer to warm up,
I felt a growing sense of excitement coming from him.
I knew that his wife and two sons and baby daughter were asleep elsewhere 
in the house,
and that he intended to view pornography.
I understood this just by being in the room with him.
As with previous experiences,
I understood everything about him—
his life, his decisions, his desires, his distress.
I perceived that he was a good man, a returned missionary ,
and presently serving in his quorum presidency.

My guide said to me, “He is here to view pornography.”

I saw eight spirits enter the room.
Four of these were evil spirits (disembodied) who had once been mortal,
the other four were unborn evil spirits— Satan’s minions.
The disembodied looked human
and wore clothing typical of the period in which they had died.
The evil spirits were less substantial , generally smaller ,
with misshapen features, making them look slightly inhuman.
They were agitated, active, jumping around in a frenzy,
shouting their commands to the young man in excited voices.

The disembodied spirits said little at first.
They had little ability to be heard by the young man.
They were there trying to satisfy the sexual passion
they had developed during their own lives.And.. there were both male and 
female spirits.Sadly.. their sexual addiction had followed them into the 
spirit world.
Their addiction was unending, painful, and impossible to satisfy.
It haunted them.
They were desperate to try to satisfy it endlessly.
They were pleased that they were going to shortly experience it through 
this young man.
They were intent, watching him, urging him on though he could not hear them.
They were not looking at the porn on the computer screen;
they were watching him closely ,
putting their faces in his face and screaming at him,
mocking and taunting him.
They didn’t care about the images;
they cared about sharing the body sensation of sexual gratification.

The unborn evil spirits were there to trap him,
to entice him on,
to remind him of the upcoming thrill.
They cared nothing for experiencing his passion.
They had never had a body
and were not capable of understanding the thrill—
they were there to control him,
to make him obey their words,
to keep him involved and under their “spell” as long as possible.

They gathered around him,
waiting for him to become fully involved
in the sexual ecstasy he hoped for by viewing these images.
The evil ones were reminding him of certain websites,
urging him to go on,
whispering to him how thrilling it was going to be.
They told him which images to view
and how he should feel about them.
They argued against his conscience,
giving him many reasons to ignore the voice of his conscience and carry on.
They placed their hands on him time after time ,
causing him to feel thrill after thrill.
They urged him as he clicked at his computer
to seek after the thrill, to remember it,
to need it more than anything else.
They were most interested
in keeping him focused upon his own body,
and his own thrills so effectively
that he could not feel his relationship to Christ,
the Holy Spirit, or remember his family.
All he could think of was himself
and the guaranteed gratification that was just a click away.
The more excited he grew,
the more frenzied the evil spirits became.
They became more aggressive ,
jumping at him, hitting him with their hands and cursing.
It was a loathsome thing to see.
I realized even more powerfully from seeing this
that all addictions are purely selfish;
they guarantee the instant gratification of the flesh.
Relationships are not guaranteed,
and the gratification, the positive payback of the relationship,
must be carefully maintained and worked at.
This is the reason that people turn to addictions,
because they are instant,
require little work,
and the results are guaranteed.
It is also the reason evil uses them
and promotes them so carefully,
because they push the user away
from all meaningful relationships,
especially those with the divine.

I understood that he had been awakened from his sleep
by one of these tempters
who had been influencing his dreams,
urging him to awaken and need a sexual high.
As soon as he made the choice
to get out of bed and actually partake,
the disembodied spirits had joined in.
They were drawn to him
like a moth to a search light in a dark sky.
They came at once.
By accepting the temptation,
and deciding to do it,
he had given them permission to enter him
and experience his sexual thrill with him.
I saw many disembodied spirits
competing to enter the small room with him.

The evil spirits remained at just four.

When he made the decision to partake,
all of his good intentions and desires
were immediately drowned out
by the passion and the control of the evil spirits.

The good spirits that had been near him as he slept
were forced a distance away
until he could not hear them.
Eventually they left,
driven away by his choices.
When he reached a pinnacle of lust in his body,
a black tear or rip appeared at the crown of his head.

In that instant the disembodied spirits began to attack.
They looked like football players tackling the guy with the ball.
They were hoping to share just a moment
of his physical feelings and excitement.
They acted like hungry dogs going after the same carcass.
There was fierce competition among them to be in him longer .
They fought to be next,
screaming and cursing,
throwing each other aside to enter.
As soon as one or two spirits entered,
no more could enter.

The evil spirits screamed and dove at him repeatedly
until a weaker one inside was expelled
and they took its place.
It seemed to me that the ones who were expelled
were exhausted,
jerking on the floor as if they were in a sexual thrall themselves,
mimicking the actions of the young man at the computer.
I tried to turn my face away in disgust,
but I could not.
The image was before me no matter which way I turned.

The evil ones quickly recovered and rejoined
the fight to reenter over and over.

The lust and addiction that these disembodied spirits
had built up in themselves while alive as mortals
still haunted them.
They couldn’t get rid of the lust
because they did not turn to Jesus Christ,
who could have healed them
even after their mortal lives ended.
Without His grace
they couldn’t satisfy the powerful need of the addiction.
They couldn’t escape it.
Without any way to satisfy the addiction,
it caused them pain,
and they hunted across the globe
for any opportunity
to experience the thrill again,
and thus lessen their pain
even for a brief moment.

My guide communicated to me
that when these spirits entered their victim’s body,
they could not fully feel what he felt.
It was filtered, or buffered, to them.
It was only partly satisfying,
and they could not remain long because of the competition.
So they attacked again and again.

The disembodied spirits were surrounded by darkness,
and as they passed through this man,
the darkness they possessed went into him.
He could feel it as waves of dark longing,
and it urged him to seek harder for more thrilling porn,
harder and darker images,
urging him from soft images to violent—
even perverse and vile.

He resisted at times,
and they screamed at him,
throwing themselves at him in a frenzy.
When the young man had entered the room,
I knew from the light that came with him
that he was a good man.
I could see the light that he possessed
being dimmed as he sat there.
I saw that there was far more glee in Satan’s minions
that he was breaking his covenants,
than that he was viewing pornography.
Their glee was greater in the fact
that he was a good man,
than if he was any off-the-street kind of guy
who did this sort of thing without needing much temptation.
Their triumph was greater,
their conquest was sweeter,
and their control over him was more precious,
due to the fact that this young man
had made covenants to avoid such things.
They delighted in the pain that this would cause his wife and family,
and they relished the opportunity to eventually afflict his wife
with all the dark emotions she would feel
that would separate her from the Holy Spirit.

My last view of this guy was of him leaning close to the screen,
breathing heavily, while unseen by him,
the four dark spirits screamed at him to continue,
and another dozen disembodied souls threw themselves through him
in a frenzy of unsatisfied lust.

One of the most tragic aspects of this scene
was that these spirits from the unseen world
were offering him a sense of false relationship,
giving him the sense of being fulfilled and satisfied by this experience.
He was beginning to accept these unseen visitors
as his companions,
and he was starting to enjoy having them,
welcoming their influence in helping him to decide
to partake once again
in his secret world of filth."
