Love this story and what it means to me is that if we have patience, 
gratitude, and faith, the Lord will be quick to answer our prayers. He just 
want to see if we'll trust him. This message is exactly what I needed to 
hear. If I had more patience in my own life then I could be happy like 
these people no matter the circumstances.﻿Alma made camp in Bountiful the Lamanites attacked in. Alma made it back to 
Zarahemla and was made their prophet.﻿
