Who is patient enough
To be a fisherman?
The waters can be tough
And the net you must mend!
Listen to the Lord
He will tell you where to go
And just when to drop
Down the net of faith, to grow!﻿Beautiful opening shot of the water. So clear...﻿I prefer the version of this story found in Luke.  Christ taught and 
performed miracles to convert these men; they didn't just follow Him 
because he showed up and asked.  I wonder why they chose to adapt the 
Matthew version.﻿estos videos estas en españolBrenda, that is beautifully said. I love it, this brings to life the Bible!!!! You hug Him every time that you go to Him in prayer or speak His name in 
reverence. He feels it, He knows it, and He loves you for it. The beautiful 
thing is that He would still love you the same were you to do none of it, 
but doing it allows you to feel His love. It is wonderful, isn't it?someday....supersoupysoup! someday.This is another example that he asks for all the otherchurches to leave 
there pride behind and come to his true church.Obedience baby obedience!Abandonar nuestras "redes" y seguir a Jesucristo es la muestra más grande 
de amor.I wish I could go back in time and hug Jesus.La manera correcta de seguir al Señor, siendo obedientes en todo. "And they straightway left their nets, and followed him." -Matthew 4:20
