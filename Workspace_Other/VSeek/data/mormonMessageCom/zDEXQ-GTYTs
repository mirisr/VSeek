I have seen an felt this light﻿ #discerning  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdBDuvthRAQ﻿I love it! It's great to know that when we do not receive answers right away or 
easily, it may be because God trusts us. We just need to move forward with 
faith!I love this series so much. I love Elder Bednar.We need this video in Portuguese..."Science and Religion are two independent witnesses of creation." I liked 
his statement. Wow!Yea - I love this music. I'd love to get me a copy of it!I loved this video!These series of videos are wonderful. I felt the Spirit very powerfully the 
moment I started to watch them. I love being a member of this Church!I know this is true because I have felt it in my life, even before I have 
become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints!Dang... Where can I find this music?!Truly inspired message. Thank you so much, Elder Bednar.hey are you a brother or sister of sarah campbell Incredible - all three of the films are so good. Perfect doctrine - 
exceptional filmmaking. What a powerful combination! This is amazing. Thank you for this video. The Apostle of our Heavenly Father speaks!!!I know that what Elder Bednar says in this video, is True. I hear this voice all the time when I am leaving my room every morning. I 
am so thankful that the Holy Ghost is there to prompt me to pray. When I 
pray I feel the spirit and come to know God. It is so important to pray. We 
cannot come to know God if we do not communicate with him.
