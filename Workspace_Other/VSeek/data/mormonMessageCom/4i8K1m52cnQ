Correction; it's the Joel Hills Johnson Descendants group on Facebook. 
Please pass the message! Is the family in this video real or actors? The name Cheyenne mentions, 
Susan Ellen Johnson, is the sister of my great great grandfather! If this 
family is willing, please have them visit the Joel Hills Johnson Facebook 
Group and say hello. We'd very much like to get in contact with them and 
share family history information!I lovers this!!I have been doing the family history work myself, and have learned that I 
am cousins to Joseph Smith, Jr., Bruce R. McConkie as well.
