Does anyone of you know where can i watch a full video of this concert? 
I've checked most of the Church's site but i can't find it. Please help i 
really want to watch this.It's so amazing how so many people, most of them unpaid, can come together 
to share their testimony that Christ really is the Savior. All of this for 
His glory, not theirs.Man, this video brings back memories of the one I went to! I am in the bell 
choir at my school right now and just watching those bell ringers take part 
with the Tabernacle Choir was so awesome! You can't not be touched by the 
music!its too far from my countryMy brother and his wife was in this concert!!i wish david archuleta was in video, but man, this choir really good!! i 
bought one and i always hear when i'm sad even i'm not mormon or christian, 
and it cheers me upi wish david archuleta was in video, but man, this choir really good!!I want to go to Utah again! So good. :)
