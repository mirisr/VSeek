I am so blessed to have these bible videos.﻿these video's clips of his teachings keeping going everyday thank you 
father﻿wow!  just loving these videos.  ﻿Christ authority comes from Him﻿The music on this particular video is so loud I am having trouble hearing 
the words.  Is this just me and my settings or are others also having 
trouble hearing.  If it is my settings is there something specific I can do 
to get the background music down lower?﻿The words of the Son of Man
Spark the Light of Christ within;
As we ponder deeply and
Turn our hearts unto Him.

Watching this video ﻿Just know that if ye believe not this truth your mind will be seared to 
that of your own truth know ye not that we are not our own but are given 
the choice to surrender our will that his will be done, option 2 or at the 
time of judgement he has this to say depart from me I never knew you, and 
that which is created for satan and his kingdom is where you'll spend 
eternal life it's not complicated choose life or death will choose you ﻿
