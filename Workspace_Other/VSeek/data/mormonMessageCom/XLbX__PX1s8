With such a wonderful message I am confused at so many few views.....﻿By these words of truth in the gospel I am reminded of 2 very close 
friends, not of my faith yet. But I am confident one day they will be 
because of their love & charity & deep caring of my husband and myself. I 
humbly pray a loving Heavenly Father will guide t hem7 toward the gospel & 
they will be blessed to receive it with open hearts. ﻿
