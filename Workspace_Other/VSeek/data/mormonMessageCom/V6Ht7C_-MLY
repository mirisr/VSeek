This talk completely changed my life over the course of several years after 
I first heard it. Thank you, President Uchtdorf.﻿I must get the Mormon channel﻿Thankyou  I believe that true  Amen.﻿This is one of the best talks ever! I love it so much. I'm close to 
shedding tears every time.President Uchtdorf is closely connected with the Lord Jesus Christ, the 
urgency & pertinence of His messages to humankind conveyed by the power of 
the Holy Ghost!!! I would suggest that the greatest way we can "put off the 
natural man and becometh a saint" was revealed by King Benjamin -- it is 
through YIELDING our hearts, desires, and wills to God's!!! Thank you 
President Uchtdorf for enlightening us all on better tuning into the Spirit 
and obeying His voice, promptings, feelings & influence!!!As a soon to be convert I feel blessed that my missionaries shared this 
with me as an assignment for the week. I would like to share as a testimony 
that in last weeks service at my ward still not sure of the Book of Mormon 
I felt the spirit so great in me I knew at that moment the words in this 
book were true and can't wait to learn and study what my heavenly father 
has chosen to share with all. In ending I know now the path before me to 
follow. I share this in the name of Jesus Christ. amenOver 14 million members. Countless Christians. Prophets on earth. YouTube 
available. Months after the message. [6/4/2011] Only me and 1,982 others 
have viewed this tremendous of many wondrous messages from The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. What message can be gleaned of our 
brothers and sisters? Are they ignorant of the Internet? Nope. Have they 
not found YouTube? Nope. It makes one wonder and tear drops.I believe this to be good and true
