what do you guys think about the book of mormon on broadwayI absolutely love these interviews with the Apostles. I LOVED the interview 
with Elder Bednar and LOVE this one with Elder Perry. PLEASE put more of 
these interviews with the other Apostles!! I feel I get to know them a 
little better.Th power of God manifest on earth. Thank you, Elder Perry.Priesthood is also the power to become godly or like Christ. Is it 
surprising that this type of power is received only when one is fully 
committed to the Lord's work?the image of God is certainly engraved upon Elder Perry's countenance, 
especially his eyes! such light and warmth! :)Wonderful message from a great leader.L. Tom Perry is one of my favorite apostles. Then again, I say that for 
every apostle that I hear speak. =) They all are blessings from God. Amen bro. The more you learn about the way the priesthood works, the more it makes 
sense. The apostles seem so much more approachable in these interviews :)thanks!! for the help! i needed for a talk :!)@omiolo2 You must be tired. You left no followup.It has changed my life and staying true to my covenants is priority in my 
life. It's true that you must be worthy in order to receive the holy Priesthood. 
This is a powerful video and testament. May we all strive to use the 
Priesthood worthily in this day and age when people need it more than ever. So much wisdom. D&C 84 119 For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the apowers of 
heaven; ye cannot see it now, yet a blittle while and ye shall see it, and 
know that I am, and that cI will dcome and reign with my people. Wonderful video!!The government of God.
