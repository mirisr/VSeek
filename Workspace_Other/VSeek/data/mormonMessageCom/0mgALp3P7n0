Beautiful words of eternal perspective to walk us thru this life. Not 
alone, but with a loving Savior by our side!!!!﻿AWSOME! TRUE APOSTLE OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR "JESUS CHRIST".....﻿These are all what we need.﻿This talk made my morning!﻿What a great talk, and inspiration and encouragement for those of us who 
struggle.﻿it is very challenging to be active at church when not doing everything 
right.  Nevertheless, it is best to go to church and be active as possible. 
 I will try not to disengage, but to remain engaged and hoping to do the 
right thing.  ﻿"You can do it NOW." <3i enjoyed his speeched the most because i related alot to it
