I love Jesus Christ with all my heart but there is no archaeological 
evidence of Nephites ever living. Even National Geographics and the 
Smithsonian Institute have never found evidence of these people. How do you 
explain that?I LOVE JESUS CHRIST AND HEAVENLY FATHER FOR THE BLESSINGS HE GAVE EACH AND 
EVERY ONE OF US IN THIS WORLD. I LOVE MY FAMILY AND EVERY ONE OF YOU IN 
THIS WORLD OR UP HEAVEN. I KNOW MY SAVIOR LIVES AND I KNOW THAT WE LOVE HIM 
AND I KNOW THAT JESUS LIVES AND I KNOW THAT LOVES EACH EVERY ONE OF US. I 
KNOW HEAVENLY FATHER, JESUS CHRIST AND THE HOLY GHOST LIVES AND THEY LOVE 
US LIKE WE LOVE THEM The Book of Mormon takes place from about 2200 BC to AD 421. It begins with 
a prophet named Lehi, who left Jerusalem with his family and sailed to the 
Americas under the hand of God. The Nephites lived in the Americas from 
approximately 589 BC until they were conquered by their brothers the 
Lamanites in AD 385.i just have a question. When were the "nephites" inhabiting the americas? 
What time period was this?
