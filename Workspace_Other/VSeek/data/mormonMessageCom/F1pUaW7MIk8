How well the truth about the Mormon Church is hidden.This is a great talk Of course it is written in our hearts. The Holy Spirit will come to all 
those who are called by the Father and write the laws of the Word of God, 
Jesus Christ, in our hearts. Faith comes by hearing, not the scriptures as 
the church teaches, but the Word of God that speaks directly to our hearts. 
The kingdom of God comes without observation and it is between the one who 
is called and the One who calls. A true Christian has become new not from 
the outside in but from the inside out.
