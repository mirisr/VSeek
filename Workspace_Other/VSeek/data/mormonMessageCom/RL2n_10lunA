another great conversion story. after Ammon is done preaching in Ishmael he 
gets ready to go to Nephi to preach  the Lord talks to him and tells him to 
stay out of Nephi because if he goes there the Lamanites will kill him. The 
Lord instead transfers him to Middoni to get his bother Aaron and his 
companions out of jail. King Lamoni goes with Ammon to help get them out. 
half way to Maddoni they run into the Lamanite King who is also King 
Lamoni's dad. Ammon has a discussion with him and all three go to Middoni 
and get Aaron and his companions out of jail.  ï»¿Thank you so much for uploading these :) Its a great way to overview the 
book of mormon :)
