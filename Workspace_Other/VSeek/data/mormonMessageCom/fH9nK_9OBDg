Please find the best of some songs for a Christmas﻿Keep up the good videos I love them
:D
﻿The true meaning of Christmas lies within our actions not our possessions.﻿Beautiful reminder! 
Lets give a little and care a bit more. Lets slow down and do more for one 
another.﻿This video shows you that, practically every single time, the best gifts do 
not come from the store.  The best gifts in life really come from the 
heart; that of service to others, willingly, because you want to, not 
because you have to.  And, that is what the Savior did during His mission; 
when he was living on earth. We can all learn so much, there is no such 
thing as learning everything about anything, in this life.  What do you 
think?!﻿Small things but very special gift.﻿It was so worth the 5:10 to watch!!! This is the true spirit of Christmas 
that we should have every day!!!!﻿Me gusta mucho 
al ayudar a empujar en auto recordé una experiencia en mi misión :D﻿Service to others, one of the greatest things you can give.﻿I don't have all that much and pretty much everything I do have I was given 
by him. But I'll give all my heart to my Savior. #TrueChristmas  ﻿We are singing this beautiful piece in my Chambers Choir. My favorite one 
out of all 6 songs we are singing. ﻿
