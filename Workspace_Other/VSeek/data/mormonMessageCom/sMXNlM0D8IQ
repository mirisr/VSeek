Is there a place to watch this online in English? I watched it in Spanish 
last night on BYUtv International and I would love to see it and share it 
in English. I wish I got to see this! But I live all the way in the Pacific.. I hope 
there was a DVD made..i wish they could make a dvd out of this production like they did with the 
forgotten carols....i wanted to see it so bad while i was in salt lake but 
never got the chanceI was in this production. It was a amazing experience! I know it touched 
many peoples life as well as mine.My stake did a production of Savior of the World it was great.
