This is in Mesa, AZ. I served in this ward during my mission. A wonderful 
neighborhood and ward. Inclusive of all, always serving and helping others. This is really cool!! :-) this is an excellent video, I love it! What a difference we can all make in 
the lives of those around us. I wonder what state is this ward in? Maybe 
Arizona? Just curious : )that's so awesome :)
