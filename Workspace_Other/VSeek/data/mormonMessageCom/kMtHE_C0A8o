"Arise and sing ye sons of men all praise and honor give.  Arise and sing 
to his great name who died that we might live"﻿beautiful song﻿I am happy that I am a latter day saint!﻿This BYU-I Choir sings just as well as the Tabernacle. Very impressive and 
moving.tis beautiful, tis beautiful.Dann kommt der rettungs tag hinein Profeten tat es kund. Die Heiligen vor 
Gott hinknien Und Satan wird verstummt! Der heilige Millennenium! Bereite 
mich o Herr, daß ich mich finde immerzu auf Zion’s Berg mit dir! It doesn't get more beautiful than this. :)Wonderful! The arrangement was made by Rendall Kemptonsi esa si la tengo lo que quiero saber es si habra alguna manera de 
ocnseguir el arreglo gracias ;) ME encanta!!!! I ♥ this hymn :DI've probably heard this hymn many times during my life, nothing really 
stood out to me. However, ever since I heard my wife sing it part of a 
choir concert at BYU-Idaho in 2004, it quickly became one of my favorites. 
I was moved deeply during the performance that I found myself in tears. My 
wife later told me it was one of President (now Elder) Bednar's favorite 
hymns. Seven years later this choir was able to convey that same spirit. 
Bravo! Bravo!One of my favorites hymns since that ocation! Love hearing it.@RickMcDL Trata de buscar el himno en music.lds.org. Este himno esta solo 
en el himnario de ingles asi que tienes que buscarlo con el nombre en 
ingles tal como aparece. my sister was in the first row. <3 Se puede conseguir la partitura de este arreglo????Just beautiful, I wish my university had such a great choir, then I would 
absolutely join it!!!really good and STRONG!so the part where its showing close ups of everyone in my row and when it 
gets to me the camera goes down and only shows me from the neck down is 
kinda a bummer..Yay Christian! @ minute 2:06 you looked great!so awesome......Great song! It's awesome to see you here Scott!
