I am a convert to the church at age 28, I like hearing positive stories, 
however some of us have endured and survived some horrendous situations, 
and these stories seem to scare the sensibilities of most people in the 
church including those who you would think would be the most Empathic. Not 
all of us were raised in Utah or some community where 90% of your neighbors 
are members. We have a story to tell every bit as important and as 
inspiring. Thanks Anyway, H A N D
