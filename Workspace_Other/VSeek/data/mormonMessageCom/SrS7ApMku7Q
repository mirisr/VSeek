group of Hispanic day laborers. Waiting for a job. As the day goes on one 
man sees others get picked up before him, he reflects on his family at 
home, his struggle to feed them. Then the relief he feels, not just to be 
picked up at the 11th hour, but to receive a full days wage. It is good for 
us to remember that they are children of God, and to understand their 
plight.I really needed this message.
