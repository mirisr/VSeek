Missing you Jared. I watch this video of you on here a lot.. rest in peace ï»¿That first scripture from Doctrine and Convenants 107 has got to be 
President Monson's favorite scripture! I look forward giving a baby blessing for my son, our first child, tomorrow 
at church. The priesthood & the service that it entails has blessed my life 
so much & I know it will bless my son as allows the gospel & the priesthood 
to develop him into a Christ-like man.
