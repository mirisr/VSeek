I don't think girls will see this as stalking. If it is done gently and 
sincerely it is not a negative but positive that there were second efforts. Everyone likes a little chase! My husband "Stalked" me. It's okay when 
they're a good guy!Girls don't see that as "following up." More like "being a stalker."
