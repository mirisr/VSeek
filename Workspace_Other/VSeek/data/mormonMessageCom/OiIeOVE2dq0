I was wondering if, in these presentations, someone could address how a 
woman who is divorced should choose a career path, or a new spouse.Great counsel. Thanks for these videos. :Dinteresting how he basically says that in order to find the right spouse, 
we have to know who we are. So....what am I supposed to do or look for when choosing a spouse? ....he 
danced around the topic like an experienced politicianThis was great, but less like the title than I thought... !
