really the day down is breaking: this song has been my family opening hymn 
when ever we are having devation almost every morning before we pray, it is 
so inspirational.﻿In many a temple the Saints will assemble
And labor as saviors of dear ones away.
Then happy reunion and sweetest communion
We'll have with our friends in the beautiful day.
Beautiful day of peace and rest,
Bright be thy dawn from east to west.
Hail to thine earliest welcome ray,
Beautiful, bright, millennial day.

I plan to use this hymn to present a lesson on family history and temple 
work in a few weeks. What a powerful message presented is such a beautiful 
way!﻿I love the contrast between the sisters and the brethren. bass and the 
soprano 3:50 - 4:04 Beautiful harmonize!I love this song
