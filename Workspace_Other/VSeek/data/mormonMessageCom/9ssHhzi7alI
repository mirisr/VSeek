this video, it is so wonderful. I love all of these videos. So touching. I hope this truly shows how great prayer and the Holy Ghost 
are!! - happy Mormon!This video describes the story President Uchtdorf gave in October 2008. I 
was reading it this week, his Mom had such faith and hope, reading it made 
me cried.I liked the part where she was praying. then she started running then she 
found the train, and when she got there she hugged her kids! that is the 
lords power! i like god he help youcaptures emotional stress of a parent traveling alone with her children 
poignantly. Made me feel very happy for her when she found the train with 
her kids on it!!That was really good I was so surprised.Adorable and spiritually uplifting. I don't often get distracted when doing 
homework but when I do, I watch Mormon Messages.This made my Day! Much love to you all :) Why <3 Allways something´s remind me of Grannies history ? <3lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/the-infinite-power-of-hope?lang=eng 
October 2008Beautifully done! Thank you so much for the touching animation. We love it!Please be comforted, Lansing Allison. Families can be together forever and 
Doctrine and Covenants 138: 47 and 48 supports and confirms and reaffirms 
this. I encourage you to go to Mormon.org and get yourself a free copy of 
the Book of Mormon or even watch videos. Your Heavenly Father loves you and 
wants you to know the things I am sharing with you. Bless you on your 
journey.curious why more of the spoken words were't used? This is confusing to kids 
who don't understand what she is frantically looking for.October 2008 conference :) Very touching story.where can you find the talk for this and what general conference was this  You can download the music as a free mp3 by clicking the link in the video 
descriptionQue lindo eu adorei obrigado!!!!Thank you for this message. Our 3rd old daughter once wandered away while 
at a friend's house. We started running and searching but the first thing 
we did was to pray. A friendly neighbor had her because she saw her out by 
herself. Such relief! Thank you very much for this.Beautiful... this video made me cry I just came from donating blood for a friend 
daughter suffering from rear blood sickness and the mom just ask me if I 
believe in anointing oil I had on me and took time to teach her about the 
mighty priesthood and gave her daughter a blessing and saw wonderful love 
and faith this mom demonstated not being of my religious faith.thanks! love the video, story, music and President Uchtdorf of course :-) me too i love the backround and story i like music alot Beautiful. I hope that the story of his family going across the border is being 
created to share in a way such as this one. The moment when he and his 
mother were eating lunch and realized that they had not yet crossed over is 
amazing...and his siblings hopping off the train...wow.. too much. Such 
faith. Love this family. 不要懷疑，只要信。Is there any place that I can buy and download the piano sheet music for 
this piece? It is so beautiful!I have lived similar situations, never this harrowing, but always with the 
same result. Prayer brings help, and peace.Seek out the missionaries where you are, you will never be dissapointed you 
did and you will be blessed in so many ways, God be with you Ronda, a friendI really love the videos that the church puts out that are animated like 
this! Such as the one from family search. :-DIs there anyway we can get a copy of the sheet music to this?:'-) beautiful storyThis is one of the greatest videos I've seen in a very long time.Beautiful!perfect mother's day video!so there's no sheet music for it? That's a shame, I would love to learn itxtinctsurfer7, the music in the background was created specifically for 
this message. You can download the music as a free mp3 by clicking the link 
in the video description. We're glad you liked the video! We love to watch these videos with our children and my 4 year old kept 
asking during this one "what's happening ma'am?" And then at the end he 
say, "whoa, good one!" Lol. I love the spirit these videos have. Thank you.Great story. also, Does anyone know the name of the piano music being 
played in teh background? Que Hermoso Video!! Las Madres Son Las Mejores del MundoI know the story because I've heard Pres. Uchtdorf tell it before in 
detail, but without more narration, it would be difficult for someone who 
has never heard it before to understand exactly what happened. Woow que hermoso mensaje :') las madres son unicas en esta vida debemos de 
apreciarlas :)
