your service ideas to my ward here in Missouri and see what service we can 
provide this area of ours. Continued blessings to all of you.Love this video on the importance of serving others! Very inspiring thank 
you!Excellent Video!! I do have family who lives in Henderson, NV!!Just BEAUTIFUL!^.~This is a wonderful example of service. Thank you for leading the way in 
demonstrating what a true Christian service project is all about, by going 
out into the communities and lending a helping hand, to someone you don't 
even know.I too have had the wonderful opportunity to find and implement these types 
of projects in the Simi Valley Community, they truly are a blessing. We 
have also invited other faith based groups to join us, and most recently 
the Muslim Mosque join us in sustaining our only food pantry feeding 3000 + 
a month with the Salvation Army with 7 tons of food! This video says it all 
, service among friends and community brings great joy!Mormons worldwide will a better world and a cleaner !!!!I love this. Made me feel real good inside. I just sent the link to my
