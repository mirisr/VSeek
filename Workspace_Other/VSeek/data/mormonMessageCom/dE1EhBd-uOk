thanks a lot<3﻿Awesome Message!!﻿"If you trust God enough to listen for His message in every sermon, song, 
and prayer... you will find it. And if you then go and do what He would 
have you do, your power to trust Him will grow, and in time you will be 
overwhelmed with gratitude to find that He has come to trust YOU." Not only 
is it a great ability to be able to trust our Lord and to find what he is 
trying to tell you through spiritual activities, but to know that the Lord 
trusts YOU is an amazing feeling and knowledge which strengthens you to 
become more honest and humble with yourself. It is a reversible cycle my 
dear brothers and sisters. The more you put your trust and faith into God, 
he in return trusts you, and his acknowledgment, trust, and love he gives 
to us enables us to trust and believe in Him all the more. I loved this 
talk and I love you brothers and sisters! Keep pushing on!﻿I am also grateful to be back in the true gospel. i have been inactive in 
the gospel been busy lately and not have been attend Church lately. For me
