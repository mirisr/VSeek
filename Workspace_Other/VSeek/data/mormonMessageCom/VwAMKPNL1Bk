I finished all the episode in 1 sitting and funny thing i have used half a 
roll of tissue in crying.. :-) so nice!! I'll wait for the District 2 :-)I love this series, it really gives me a better understanding of what the 
elders go through.I know this is my church .Love this series so much! My only complaint is that there aren't many 
episodes and the are released too far apart!It would be very nice if there is including subtitle in the video.I can't wait until episode 8 comes out. As a convert, it is amazing to see 
others with similar issues as I had, and he amazing work the missionaries 
do to bring others the fullness of the Gospel. I got sucked into these 
videos and finished the first 7 in 2 days, and now I'm sad I watched them 
so fast lol. Truly amazingThese are really well put togetherLove, love, love this!That is a good videoGo missionaries!
