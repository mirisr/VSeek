thats a pure love of christ...﻿yea. very Spiritually things.﻿ha I love the Gospel. and i love the serving Others. Because i am a mormon.﻿Such a wonderful video. Lift where you stand. :)﻿bonito﻿Watched this in the third hour of Church today. It's very touching how 
service can change lives :)﻿wow, great story. .... inspiring﻿Tears from My eyes....and this touch My soul, tanks....life is supose To be 
good.. ;-)﻿Good video, excellent message to ponder! Thank you!   Living a life of 
service, there is no better and worthwhile life to live. There is the 
promise of Jesus that by losing ourselves in the service of others, we find 
ourselves!  =)﻿Beautiful & so very touching!!!
Came close to tears as the emotions hit while watching it!!!
I had 3 cousins, only 1 left alive in this mortal world now, who each had 
M.S.!  It does get to a point when they can't do even the simplest things, 
like get themselves into bed on their own, & they need help!
There are many other circumstances where our sisters or brethren may be in 
need of help, & we as children of God our Heavenly Father need to remember 
this & do our best to serve our sisters & brothers!  
Thank you for posting this video!!!﻿Wow! You guys are amazing!!!  That's what I love about the guys in our 
church!  Is how real, how great the priesthood, the men are.  I've really 
been taught that men are not all bad, as I was almost convinced of before I 
joined.  Love that when most men in our church get together for something, 
it's for such wonderful causes as this, although it's not always well 
noticed, in fact most good ppl do in our church is never known of.  I know 
when I have needed help in the past and couldn't count on my family, they 
have helped me and my sons.  I have so many stories of the good brethren! 
We've moved so many times, that wow, we've become really good at it now, 
but I recall when we didn't have the money for a moving truck and a bunch 
of the guys from church came over on their free Saturday and moved us from 
San Dimas to La Puente in pickup trucks and we all looked like a big moving 
convoy and we stopped at a mini mart and got stuff to drink and everyone 
was so nice and we all had such fun. I felt so loved, my boys did too. When 
we got to the destination, the brethren there, at the new ward were ready 
to help unload everything. It was all so amazing and so well planned. I 
wasn't used to being helped and felt to grateful, it was just so cool. They 
had the pay it forward thing going way back before the movie ever came out!﻿I am inspired. There are still good people in the World! This brings me so 
much joy. I also have MS and one day I saw this Ted Talk of a Dr. who 
recovered form MS using food. I decided to try it and I got my health back 
too. We truly are what we eat!  Please pass this onto Cathy.

...I was thinking this would be a "regular" help story.  This had so much 
more than just one, or even two sides to the story.  Just keep watching 
till at least the 3 minute mark, you'll be hooked then!  ;)﻿It's easy to serve someone if the come to you an ask.  You know what you 
need to do and how to do it.  It's hard to serve someone who needs service, 
but doesn't ask.  If we could tap into that kind of service, we could make 
a huge difference in humanity.﻿#lift﻿This last spring I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, things like this 
touch me deeply. It's odd to think how my point of view has changed so 
drastically. In the months leading to the diagnosis I have matured in ways 
so unexpected. I am blessed to be at full function, no one could tell that 
I have this unpredictable chronic disease. Although I have this, I am of 
greater understanding of the Love of Christ, and my God, the joy of the 
gospel cannot be undone!﻿"Lift where you stand"﻿This is really neat. I actually live in the ward where this takes place, so 
I know most of the men in this video. My dad has even helped get Kathy into 
bed numerous times. These are all great men. And it's a great message.﻿One of the best, most uplifting videos I've watched in a really long time. 
Makes me want to dedicate my life more to serving others!﻿I love this video so much and these guys for doing this!﻿That's awesome,that Mormon's ,do that for people.﻿+dillydadally thank you!﻿Amazing﻿" When we heal the body, it's always an inward effort, paying attention to 
our self. When we heal the soul, turning inward doesn't work. The medicine 
of the soul lies in turning outward to other people. "﻿Genuine care and selfless actions speak louder then the loudest most 
spiritual sermon.  Refreshment to a distressed soul,  and people can tell 
when your motives are sincere.  I just want to help you, these are the real 
hero's God's hands answering our prayers.﻿'I will do it myself,.... every night if I have to,..."  the righteous 
examples of others that shed light on the path that we try to follow,... 
thank you.﻿“The more we serve our fellow men in appropriate ways, the more substance 
there is to our souls.  We become more substantive as we serve others. 
 Indeed, it’s easier to find ourselves because there’s so much more of us 
to find.”  -Elder D. Todd Christofferson﻿“It’s interesting, the dichotomy between healing the body and healing the 
soul.  When we heal the body, it’s always an inward effort; we’re always 
paying attention to our self.  When we heal the soul, turning inward 
doesn’t work.  The triage of the soul is found in turning outward to other 
people.”﻿The message of this movie is so touching but as I think about it all of us 
can be doing something to help others. I found that's really important for 
me to stop and look for opportunities to change the lives of people around 
because almost every time I do I notice an opportunity I missed.﻿Beautiful story. Inspiring, uplifting, true. Thank you for producing this.﻿great comment on unselfish service.﻿I had the privilege to work with HOSPICE as a CNA and I enjoyed every 
moment of helping each person as they gradually passed.  I also at my 
sophomore year in high school help take care of my grandfather while he was 
passing from cancer and helped with my grandmother because she had had many 
strokes.  I gave up a full year of sports and helped to take care of my 
grandparents.  It was such a privilege to help as in the future I'd learn 
that HOSPICE had worked with my grandfather.  The RN who helped him 
remembered me when I later applied to HOSPICE 10 years later. She hired me 
because she saw how I handled my grandparents.  Blessings in disguise.  =) 
 Service is a wonderful tool to help others as well as ourselves.﻿That is a powerful video.﻿Why hasnt this been hitting millions of views yet? This is so powerful. 
Healing the soul is not turning inward, the real power comes from serving 
those outward from ourselves.﻿This is the essence of the Gospel of Jesus Christ!  It is humbling to watch 
these kind men serve this woman that needs them to much!﻿I truly love their honesty in how they felt before, during, and after this 
experience!  I have been edified...thank you!﻿Loved this. Great message. ﻿Love this so much!! 💜💜💜 'You' CAN make a difference. I wish we could all 
flip the switch to look for the blessing of service, vs the burden. Life 
changing. ﻿So inspiring!!!!﻿Beautiful.﻿
