I am an addict, and a Mormon, and I feel shunned by the church- no ones 
calla, no one comes to see me anymore, and it makes me feel so alone- I was 
a primary teacher for so long!﻿This is an amazing series.﻿Thank you for your story Preston, I really felt the spirit of your

the spirti.﻿Hey brother thanks for sharing ... John Step 9.﻿He's there.﻿Couldn't keep em in﻿Amazing series! So inspired by this! Thank you!﻿Preston the other day in training I was asked to think of a moment in my 
life when I knew there was something bigger than me. A moment of awe or 
amazement. 
I closed my eyes and thought of the moment. It was the day I prayed and 
asked God to let me know if what I was about to do was what he wanted me to 
do. Then I went to church the first time after 15 years. It was the best 
feeling I have ever felt, my body and soul was filled with love and warmth 
that is almost impossible to describe.
I always knew there was a God and believed in God. At that moment it was 
undeniable and I knew how much he loved me. I knew everything was going to 
be ok.
God bless you for sharing your story. You have brought hope and light into 
my life! Thank you for sharing your truth and light.﻿
