I am looking forward to the video, "A Savior is Born". I am hoping that you 
will make it available on the YouTube Mormon Channel, as one can transmit 
it from an Android device to a WiFi device or Blu-Ray player.﻿love👍👍👍﻿I wish I could sing as good as you.﻿Lexi is like an angel.Her voice + she = angel
