Pushing or forcing is different with sharing. Mixing or adding is not 
polluting or diluting. If confident with what you have, then you have no 
fear of listening or considering other teachings. It might be better. 
Consider this things. I promise you that you will know more than what you 
have, do not be so coward to resist other things for you to grow. This is 
the purpose of life, to grow, improve, and become better until we become 
our best. In your effort not to dilute yourself by conforming to one belief, your are 
diluting the most basic and simple logic. Truth is not an opinion, it is 
black or white. Mixing more than one item can give the appearance of grey, 
but each individual item is true or false. God said, requires, is, did or 
what have you or he didn't. Referring to "push you beliefs", If you know 
anything about the LDS Church is that forcing religion on someone is 
against their beliefs, it would take away one's agency. Pushing our beliefs on other people is against our religion.I really hope you don't push your beliefs on anyone. That should be against 
your religion. There are many pathways to enlightenment. I personally don't 
want to dilute myself by conforming to one belief or pathway to that 
enlightenment.
