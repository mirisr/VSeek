Now I'm proud to live in Latvia :)﻿Wow! This is a fantastic series. I've watched all 16 episodes in the last 
two days. What a fabulous idea to do this and Rick Stevenson must have been 
truly inspired to pick this family. What amazing, hard working, dedicated 
boys. I'm in awe ...﻿Watching this series has made me see what the missionaries struggle 
through. I used to always think that serving in a foreign country and 
speaking a foreign language would be cool but I've failed to see the 
reality behind all that. I respect the missionaries who struggle through 
this but I know the Lord would always be with you if you do your part and 
ask of him to do the rest. Love goes out to all the missionaries and for 
their hard work and effort and prayers they commit to :) Love all the 
missionaries x﻿These videos have really made me cry because of how spiritually uplifting. 
The videos have really changed my life. They have really made me want to 
change how I act to my siblings﻿Will there be more episodes??﻿Finish watching all the episodes, wow I've learned so much from them. I've 
learned so much from their experiences, and also from the right choices 
that they made in their lives. Thumbs up. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😊😊😊 Inspiring 
indeed!﻿please continue this series! it's so wonderful!!!﻿Hello all the way from Brazil! I just want to thank you for sharing these 
wonderful stories. I am a mother of 3 boys and a girl, and watching this 
made my heart melt several times. May the Lord bless you with your goals 
and dreams.﻿I only discovered this series a few months ago so I have been able to watch 
multiple episodes at a time. I have 4 grandsons who are, I think, about the 
same in age apart as the Nelson brothers. I have truly loved watching this 
series! Many many thanks to the Nelson family and you and your crew for 
putting this together - I have loved the journey and admire this family so 
much! Love to you all!﻿I think that was the most impacting and importing thing i have watched in a 
very long time i have spent the past two days watching the series and i 
have definitely helped a lot with some decisions i have to make, thank you 
for making this series!!!﻿Its not an easy thing but you will get there﻿This has been the BEST series, especially following these young men through 
their missions. I hope that they are all followed up with again down the 
road - their sharing their lives with us has made such an amazing impact. 
Thank you!﻿I will be a missionary, and I know that one day I'll face those trials he 
has been through, and I am not afraid of it, cause I know that Jesus Christ 
always there watching me and every each one of us, rely on him.﻿I really like this but what about Joseph?﻿I have really enjoyed watching these videos, seeing these boys grow into 
great men who continue to serve in the best way that they can for the Lord 
and their families. Thank you for this series, it has been inspiring.﻿are they gona make another one﻿This can't be the last episode. These boys/men have inspired so many. 
Please continue with their stories!﻿You. Can't. Stop. It. Yet.﻿Loved this series.﻿Thanks so much for these kind comments. It's been a joy being able to cover 
the Nelson family. They are extremely humble and a bit uncomfortable with 
all of the attention but gave me the go-ahead upon learning that their 
struggles and challenges could help other people. So thank you all for 
speaking to that impact. And yes, I have several other kids around the 
world I have followed as a part of the 5000 Days Project hopefully we will 
find the means to share those as well. We are currently developing the 
technology to enable every child to create a time-capsule of themselves 
growing up regardless of location and a short version in already available 
in three Discovery Centers and 20 Stake Centers. Remember, you own nothing 
more precious than your own story. Rick Stevenson﻿I want my son to go on mission﻿I think we need a reunion episode﻿Please make more episodes of their lives this videos are our inspiration 
God bless you and thank you.😀﻿I'm currently working on converting my girlfriend (i am 17, she is 18) .. 
thanks so much for this video! This and many others are opening her comfort 
level of accepting that I am going on a mission -)﻿this link was shared to me by my singles ward bishop and it was great to go 
back and relive some of my greatest memories. I served in Estonia and even 
though Estonians and Latvians pride themselves in their own customs, the 
struggles as a missionary are the same. it took me a long time to love the 
Estonians and learn their language but when it happened I couldn't get 
enough. I loved the work dearly. additionally, it was so hard to share 
experiences with loved ones when I got home because those experiences were 
so sacred to me. mighty Baltic mission... life changing.﻿El Señor bendiga por siempre a los jóvenes que predican el evangelio. 
Gracias por compartir estas experiencias como misioneros al estos 
maravillosos hermanos!﻿He is very lucky. You can feel the spirit in Latvia a lot.﻿Thanks for a great series. May the Lord bless and strengthen all those 
young men and women who love and serve so selflessly on their missions. May 
all those young men, who have years to go until their missions, be inspired 
by your sons examples.﻿Inspiring series, thanks for sharing your stories and for being good 
examples, bummed that it's over.﻿Hopefully in a few years we can see more Tommy and Joseph updates? :) These 
documentaries are amazing. I hope lots of young people who are about to go 
on missions are watching these. PS, to all those who loved Two Brothers - 
go watch Listen on BYUTV's website - the same documentarian interviewed a 
bunch of other, non-LDS, kids, and those documentaries are excellent as 
well!﻿This was an amazing series. I wish I could watch this family every week. 
BYUtv should make this family a weekly series! What incredible people. I 
loved watching them mature and become amazing people.﻿Im watching these series they are amazing !!!! please continue﻿is that the end? Oh man, keep going!! Love it!﻿If not making more with this family make more with another.﻿I don't want it to be over! I loved this series so so much!! I'm gonna miss 
watching this every week. I always looked forward to Friday's because I got 
to watch this. I don't know how I'm gonna survive now!﻿IF POSSIBLE PLEASE CONTINUE THE EPISODES!!﻿oh my goodness 
I really loved watching these series! I really wish that you guys can still 
continue the series! I actually wanted to see Joseph go on his mission!!﻿It was wonderful !﻿Thanks family!  I enjoyed watching every episode.  I LOVED so many that I 
can't pick a favorite.  What I am committing to because of your video 
series is to pray more often for our Missionaries.....that they will have 
strength to follow your example of pushing through!  Just DO IT!  Enjoy the 
next fifteen years!﻿I want more 2 brothers 2 :(﻿Two Brothers 3 please.﻿I don't want this one to be the last😣﻿Oh my gosh! That was so amazing. I'm so sad it over!!! This show has taught 
me so much. I loved getting to know these people and watch some of there 
journey. I could connect so well! I'm so sad it's over but I'm happy it 
happened!﻿thank you so much for this episodes. it is so inspiring and uplifting and 
all good feelings. thanks Rick Stevenson for coming up something like this.

always! more episodes please and even if it comes from other families.﻿Thank you Mormon Channel for another heart felt episode! I have laughed and 
cried watching this series. I am so happy for Elder Tommy Nelson and that 
his mission for the Savior is a success...Regards from Australia....﻿I have watched EVERY episode so far and I cry each time I watch them.  I 
have 3 boys, Reid (5) Hudson (3) Weston (1) and I can't wait for them to 
grow up and be so close with there brothers and go on missions to learn and 
grow. Thank you SO much for filming this family, it has truly influenced my 
life and my goals as a parent.  I love the gospel of Jesus Christ with all 
my heart and my only desire is to have those around me love it to! Elise 
Freeman﻿This series has been such a joy to watch!  Im so incredibly sad its over. 
These Brothers are something else!  Thanks for sharing﻿please keep making these videos I love them!!!﻿is this really the end? where is joseph mission?﻿Wowow. This gospel has got to be true! Love to all from Colombia!﻿Wowow. This gospel has got to be true! Love to all from Colombia!﻿Wowow. This gospel has got to be true! Love to all from Colombia!﻿Wowow. This gospel has got to be true! Love to all from Colombia!﻿I loved the entire series and feel the same way as many when I heard this 
episode would be the final. Nooooo!! Being a father of 5 children (4 boys), 
these experiences that have been shared have strengthened the relationship 
of my children. They are all very touching, but Episode 3 is probably my 
favorite. Thanks for the last 16 weeks. Fridays will still be something to 
look forward to but for different reasons.﻿Is this really the final episode? I'll be so sad if it is. I have really 
enjoyed this series and have gleaned a lot from it to help me and to help 
my kids through life.﻿Amazing series. Sad that it's over.﻿I served in Europe as well: Northern England.  Since my first day in the 
field, I would always start the conversation with, "Pardon me, where can I 
get a cheese danish here?"  It always gets them to ask, "what is that," 
"where are you from?" or "what are you doing in England?"﻿Watching this series has been interesting.  Me being around the same age as 
the Nelson boys, when I first started watching the videos, I found myself 
pridefully/enviously comparing myself to them and making judgments.  But as 
I continued to watch them I developed more love for all of them and really 
enjoyed watching each episode hoping the best for them.  
The videos really brightened my days and made me want to be better.  Wish 
they weren't over, and wish we could see a follow-up video from their 
parents perspective and hear what they have to say.  It really is so cool 
see how the influence of the gospel shaped all of these boys to become 
wonderful young men.  Love the gospel of Jesus Christ.  #sharegoodness
Thanks goes to all those who made these videos possible!﻿this is really awesome to see, my cousin is on the same mission in Latvia 
right now, and now I get to see what it is like for her!:)﻿I hope you make more of these! They're great!﻿The Lord gives tailor made challenges in order for us to learn & grow so 
that we might become more & more like him. He will definitely bless when 
obey & sacrifice.﻿Sooooo.....episode next week? Or no?﻿more shows﻿What an incredible and powerful testimony! I also served in Latvia and can 
completely relate. You had me in tears but happy tears. Knowing that my 
mission is being taken care of by such a humble missionary. God bless your 
family!﻿Elder Gentry is my cousin!﻿As of 2011, Latvia's Justice Ministry had registered 1,145 congregations 
across 22 faiths, four of them Mormon comprising 852 members. So the Two 
Brothers are not exactly alone! I hope they have a great mission and learn 
a lot!﻿Please keep making episodes! It's my favorite show!﻿This series was the best! Thank you Mormon Channel, for putting this out, 
and making my life better!﻿Love these﻿Thank you! This has been a great series. I'm sad it's over.﻿This gives me the feels﻿No final narration about the update on the family? So is this really the 
final episode?﻿Ahh, I miss this show already.... :(﻿It was beautiful! This series hace helped me so much. I can't express how 
grateful I am for it. I wish it was longer. Thank you for these 
extraordinary videos!﻿Nice video...very inspiring ....I can't wait to go on mission﻿That's really cool Tommy's attitude had changed so much.﻿I can't believe this series is over. I only have one thing to say. The 
Nelson boys are awesome and I can imagine the incredible parents that have 
raised them. I have followed them since the very first video where Sam and 
Luke are little. Now with Tommy and Joseph all grown up and serving 
missions it's just amazing. Whoever had the incredible idea to follow these 
young men for so long. BIG thanks to them and their parents for allowing 
the rest of us to take a pick into their lives.﻿I love this series so much.﻿Really loved this series, really sad that it's already over though :/﻿first﻿
