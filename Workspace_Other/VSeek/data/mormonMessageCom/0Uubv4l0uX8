I am a Filipino and I am so happy that even though Filipinos are facing 
problems and trials, we're still happy and moving forward. #ProudtobeaLDS﻿its amazing :-)﻿I wonder if I could do this for my 1000 hours needed to get into PA school.﻿I KNOW SISTER ANDRADA!!!!﻿With living conditions like that, it's no wonder people die from diseases, 
even ones that are generally not a big deal in places with proper 
sanitation.﻿In the last 12 years more than 100 people have died from the measles 
vaccine in the US.  In the same 12 years only one person has died of 
measles and that person was vaccinated.  No brainer.﻿First





;(﻿Wow! God bless this wonderful sister who has so much passion to help her 
community! I am so glad to see my tithes and offering helping those in 
need.....﻿once again, not liking the fact that part of my tithes are going towards 
this.  21 deaths in a year and they are calling for immunization? How many 
of those cases are due to the fact that they're without proper nutrition? 
 How about we start attacking the real cause of this "epidemic", instead of 
trying to play it off with a couple of shots filled with poisons?﻿Wow. Amazing.﻿Thanks for the vídeo!!﻿Best video ever :) ! I am so proud!﻿Who's the dip who downvoted this? Very good video!﻿
