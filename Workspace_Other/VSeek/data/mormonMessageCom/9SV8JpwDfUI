I've never been in a tight knit quorum. Everybody is quiet and keeps to 
themselves including me. I don't feel any close bond at all. I see them an 
hour on sunday that's it. I enjoy going to hear the message but have no 
friends. I'd like to be in a close group where we are truly happy to be 
there not just fake posers. I'm guilty toopart three, pleasesamoan\\\\\ @matthewsorenson46 me too... glad to learn about this, such big help to 
institute teachers like me!"it is a service organization"
