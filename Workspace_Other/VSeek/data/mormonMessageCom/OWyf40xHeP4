I really love these little snippets of tips. I've come across people that 
think Mormonism is so narrow minded, but I think it's me not knowing how to 
pull those deep vast feelings out into words to helps others see what we 
believe. So thank you to whoever came up with the idea to create these 
videos!Share who u are
