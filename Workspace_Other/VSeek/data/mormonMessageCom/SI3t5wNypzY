This is so beautiful! I love it.﻿I love all song..It's so lovely heart .....﻿Love this hymn.  So profound.  So enlightening!!!!﻿I remember hearing this for the first time 2 months after I joined the 
church Oct 2001 I was in tears the good kind.amazing! the choir makes my Sundays. I remember watching th october 2007 conference when the entire congregation 
ended up standing...first time I had ever seen that while singing the final 
verse with the choir. Still moves me to think about it.Love this song before I converted to the LDS church and now after I was 
baptized I love this song even more.This is truly beautiful...and I am very thankful for our prophet!I'll never forget hearing this in person last week one of the most 
incredible moments of my life I love being Mormon I love when the Tabernacle Choir sings on general confrence, thanks mormon
