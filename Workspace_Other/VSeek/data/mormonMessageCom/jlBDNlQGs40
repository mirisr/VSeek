I feel him closest when I'm in the temple, when being of service to others, 
and when I pray... which is probably why I try to keep a prayer in my heart 
and a prayer in my head all day long. I can't explain what the benefits of 
doing this are because they're unique to each individual. If you want to 
know what it is, try it. You won't regret it!
