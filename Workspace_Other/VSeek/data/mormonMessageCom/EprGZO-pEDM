Christ is meek and lowly of heart we should be too! ﻿This really touched me. From President Snow. "“If the husband can live with 
his wife one day without quarrelling or without treating anyone unkindly or 
without grieving the Spirit of God … ; he is so far perfect. Then let him 
try to be the same the next day. But supposing he should fail in this his 
next day’s attempt, that is no reason why he should not succeed in doing so 
the third day.”12"
