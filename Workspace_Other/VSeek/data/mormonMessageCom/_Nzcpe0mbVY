Tell the truth the good and the bad things, encourage research then let  
them choose .  Don't rush a family to get baptize then separate them if 
they leave ,it a sin. God wants you to tell the whole true.ï»¿Um....he's better than everyone on earth.This is very Good I will use this.Elder Bednar and The Moderator Did a Very 
Good Job.In The church you never cease to learn1.) PRAY FOR INCREASED UNDERSTANDING, 2.) READ THE SCRIPTURES, 3.) THEN 
PONDER ON THEM AND ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE "RECEPTIVE" TO THE HOLY 
GHOST...YOU'LL BE SURPRISED ON HOW THE SPIRIT WORKS ON YOU...I BELIEVE THAT 
ELDER BEDNAR WAS ABLE TO REACH THAT LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING AND WISDOM 
BECAUSE OF THESE 3-STEPS...Elder Bednar is something else, how can i achieve that level of 
understanding and and wisdom?
