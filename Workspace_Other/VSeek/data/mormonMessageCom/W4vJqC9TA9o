this song and great blessing to youth﻿A very fine choir indeed, I am Catholic and love sacred music, as it is 
akin to prayer at times !﻿One of my favorite hymns of all time <3﻿Great﻿This never fails to give me goosebumps. The majestic music sung by a choir 
filled with righteous high priests of God. So perfectly powerful, 
immoveable and full of hope and faith. Thank you.arise o men of godThanks Shaun for the correction...POWERFUL!!! this is not the Mo Tab, this is a Priesthood choir of men from Ogden Utah 
who are singing at the Priesthood session of conference, but you are

Amen!Favorite song!!! Chills, goosebumps, love it!WHAT SUPERB....VOICES. i find them verry uplifting, and this wonderful hymn
