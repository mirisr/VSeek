One of the best talks ever.This guy is a great leader.@BrenttheGreat He presided at our Stake Conference today, actually:D I was 
the youth speaker, and after my talk he got up and, standing at the pulpit 
with his arm around me, asked me to bear my testimony about staying strong 
despite all the evil in the world. Today was one of the coolest days ever:DWould be great if everyone in the world would think about the type of 
person they could BE.I listened to this talk while doing cardio earlier this evening and 
immediately received a flood of inspiration about what to do in the 
classroom with my students this year. This is an EXCELLENT talk for anyone 
who works with children, whether by profession, by church calling, or by 
family responsibility.Wow.....Great parenting advice!@BrenttheGreat That is great!! This was an amazing talk, extremely deep.I felt that this talk touched me the most. thank you.He was the presiding authority at my Stake Conference recently. We really 
grew to love him. What an amazing man. Great talk.
