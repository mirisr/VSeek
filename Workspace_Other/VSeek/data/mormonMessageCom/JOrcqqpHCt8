Sorry, Mormon Channel, thanks for the music. You Rock!!!!!!﻿I know that I am child of God. I know that everyone in the world, also to 
everyone were in world, and also to everyone who will come into the world 
are children of God.﻿God's my father and I'm his son.﻿I LOVE this video﻿Hey guys, if you like this video, check out my talk on Patience and tell me 
what you think. I have a dream to motivate and inspire others to live the 
gospel more fully and more enthusiastically.﻿Me too﻿Hi, My name is kyla, I am 13 and one day, A fww weeks before that my dad 
said to me "Kyla, why is it the god alows suffering, what does he do for 
the children in slavery?" And through this i cried and cried i had no 
answer to give to my dad for my dad is not religious but me my mom and my 
sister are religious. Its hard to twll my dad something or and someone he 
does not believe in. Its also been hard to go to church because my mom 
works and my dad works to and if i can't get to church i pray, watch your 
channel's videos, or and read the book of Mormon i have not found the bible 
yet through th e mess of book in boxes.


Thanks for the help through the ups and downs! You mean alot! 

/Kyla﻿I believe it!﻿I lovee this song, and it is SO true. Also why are there ANY dislikes on 
this video? Come on people this is so amazing!!!﻿beautiful.........pure...........beauty﻿Awesomely awesome song﻿Thank you all for understanding OK im ten years old and am a Mormon I live 
to teach the gospel and hopefully be missionary when I am older baptists 
think were bad and not Christian but we are we are the true church of Jesus 
and heavenly father we believe not to say the lords name. Vain or else that 
is sinning but for those who are Mormons thank you you made good choice in 
which church to join﻿John 1:12-13, we become a Child of God when we receive His Son and are born 
of Him, meaning we become "born of God"..We are His creations until then 
and not His child. We must receive His Son first..Hope this makes sense. 
God Bless.﻿awwwwwww i wish the world wasnt so cruel!﻿Anyone know who the cowboy with the great voice is?﻿
