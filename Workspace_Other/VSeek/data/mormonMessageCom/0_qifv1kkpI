Drugs sound scary. Videos like this should be shown in schools, it's so 
sad! Well down Lindsay for sharing your story! <3﻿Most of our lives when we get clean will be far from perfect but we must 
alway remember where we have been in the past in hopes to never go their 
again .﻿that's an awesome story and you're an awesome person Lindsey, thx for 
sharing﻿This is so inspiring! That's for sharing this, it's given me strength, keep 
doing what is right. I know you can do it!﻿If, like me, you'd like to hear the child's prayer she referred, here is a 
link. It seems to be the audio from the CD sold in the primary catalog. 
Feel free to pray along with her. :)
