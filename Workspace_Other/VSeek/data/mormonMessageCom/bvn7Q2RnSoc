i just love this video because i like the part when the bishop said that 
not all youth are perfect and that just makes me think about my best friend 
just because i know that she is not perfect and i do love that alot so yeah﻿That's so cool! We miss Collin so much but know he's where he needs to be 
right now! I hope your brother is enjoying his mission as well!This is a really awesome video! "Like" to the 50th power. I just happened to need this at this particular 
time :D What a stud. Well done, excellent video Anyone no matter what religion that tries to walk in the footsteps of 
Christ cant go seriously wrong :)Awesome keep strong :)Gosto muito! Ninguém é perfeito e todos nós precisamos de Jesus Cristo.Wonderful! I truly wish and pray that more Christians were like this.. it 
doesn't matter if you've been baptized or if you're a Christian.. if you do 
wrong, you do wrong, and you can't escape it unless you open up to God and 
confess.. I praise and admire the honesty of this young man, and pray that 
May God bless him and use him!That's my brother's first mission companion!I love him...what an inspiring spirit this guy has--just brilliant. I am 
proud to be a member of the same church.
