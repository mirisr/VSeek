22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made 
perfect? (New Testament | James 2:22) I love hearing the wisdom of this man! God bless you and yours.......Just the sound of Pres. Eyring's voice brings peace and comfort to my soul. 
I appreciate his testimony and service so much.The Child born in a stable a Gift for us.So transformation does not come from salvation, but from following the 
example of the saviour, being baptized, and receiving the ministration of 
the Holy Ghost. What about salvation by grace? Does that not transform 
without works? Are we not a new creature after that transformation as a 
butterfly is no longer a catapillar but a new transformed creature? 2 
Corinthians 5:17, Ephesian 2:8.9 And if we do not follow the law, we have 
no Spirit of God with us? Is that correct?Yeah merry Christmas and glory to God in the Highest :)Peace on Earth, Good will to men!Merry Christmas, and glory to God in the highest!
