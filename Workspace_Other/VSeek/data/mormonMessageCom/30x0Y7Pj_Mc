I just love this show! It's so nice to see such a wonderful family like 
this! Thank you for downloading this! May God watch over your footsteps!l﻿Where's Tommy going to serve his mission? I can't understand
I'm a fan of this brothers how they live the gospel, can't wait for the 
next episode﻿I recently had a interview at the best job where I live it seemed like a 
perfect fit with a company that really cares about its workers and I 
thought it was the best thing for me but I didn't get it and accepted it 
wasn't what was best for me or it wouldve happened i put things in Gods 
hands and now am working and I feel i am where he wants me to be. True 
happiness comes from being close to heavenly father and I learned that when 
I learned about him and lived close to him im fallen away and things got 
bad bud am reading doctrine everyday now and things are really looking up﻿These episodes are so wonderful!! I always feel the spirit when I watch 
them. They've helped me with my life because we've shared the same exact 
situations (some). Thank you :)﻿Thanks for sharing this video project.  I am really enjoying watching the 
growth and development of these you men.﻿This episode seemed so short! Can we have the next one already? Haha﻿I see my future in these boys. I have four sons. My hope is that they turn 
out so well. I'd like to see what the parents are like, they're obviously 
doing something right.﻿Love following this family and these young men! Awesome series! ﻿I love these videos! They are so uplifting and inspiring! I get excited for 
Fridays because that's when I get to see new episodes of Two brothers Two. 
"I won't. I'm a Mormon." I love it! I want that T-shirt too! ﻿I really like this show! It's so nice to see a show about a good faithful 
family. Thank you! ﻿I think a shirt that says "I choose not to . I am Mormon" is the best way 
to go.﻿I won't. I'm mormon.﻿I like being a Mormon ﻿
