Hermoso himnoSince hearing these beautiful young women sing this exhilarating song - it 
has become one of my favorites! Oh Lord prepare MY heart to stand with Thee 
on Zion's mount and never more depart! Thank you for posting this, allowing 
me to relive the sweet joy I felt as I listened to it in the conference 
center over and over again!
