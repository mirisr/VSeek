I am amazingly sad that he passed on. truly a great apostile.﻿was not KJB published more than 100 years after Tyndale death? Tyndale 
lived in the Henry VIII and King  James lived many years later?﻿I am grateful that those who made sacrifices to see that we would have the 
bible to read for ourselves...to have the word of God. I love my 
scriptures. Our lives can be blessed if we will but partake of the words of 
God daily.
