Im new at teaching . Been a member for twenty years, partially active and 
this is my first calling in about twenty years. I love having a calling. 
These kids can get pretty rowdy . so i need all the tools i can get .Its 
great when they are involved, but its very easy to loose them.  I need to 
have a better flow. Any delay or pause will give them reason to start 
goofing.  Living the gospel is key and so is prep

  ï»¿I am one that goes there during peak time but to tell you the truth I have 
prepared my lesson before but this is where I go to print out handouts for 
the next day.
