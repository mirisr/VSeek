The videos are amazing and everyone can learn from them!﻿I wish the whole world would watch these.﻿I am going to slow down watching these stories because i dont have enough 
tears, i am grateful for the atonement of Jesus Christ now i can endure 
many things.﻿Good video but my dad would call me after 13 minutes.﻿These principles are so inspired- watching these videos are like being 
drenched in emotion and hope. This is a fallen world, but we have access to 
divine power as we navigate the journey of our lives. So grateful for this 
series and the light it is bringing to all of us.﻿I'm gonna have to take a break watching these in a row, don't want to get 
dehydrated, cryin so much. :)﻿This is one of my favorites﻿I thought I was watching these videos to help a friend, but now I am 
realizing how these principles apply to all of us to become better 
disciples of Christ. These are beautiful and are inspiring me to have a 
greater change of heart and more trust in the Lord. The atonement of Jesus 
Christ is much more powerful and deep than many of us realize.﻿These videos are drenched by the spirit. Thank you so much for publishing 
them!﻿
