where is the rest of the movie﻿for me, this video makes learning about the Bible interesting and fun  :)﻿You hear the word but your eyes are still shut. Easter? Sunday worship? I 
pray you do as that great king did amen﻿the scribe ShaphanMy old friend Javen Tanner from Kanab High played King Josiah, Amen ! I had never heard of this story until I saw this video and it was so 
impressive that I wondered why I'd never heard of it. It's a great story- 
it shows the importance of scriptures in the lives of a church and a 
people. Without vision, a people perish. So just a few years before Lehi left in 601This is extremely beautiful! After finished reading the book of 2 Kings, I 
told myself that I had to watch a video about the life of Josiah! Thank you!The word of God has more power on the hearts and minds of men (and women) 
than the sword. What a wonderful, true story.Who is supposed to be narrating here?93 93/93They treated those words as if it was a treasure found! i hope all today 
all would also treat their scriptures that way.. more! more! Gosh, this clip edited out the part where King Josiah ordered all the pagan 
priests slaughtered and their graves desecrated. I mean, that has to be it, 
right? Certainly something that important wouldn't be left out, right?im not a mormon, but i really like these videos.Great to watch to start my day at work. InspiringJosiah recognized the importance of the Holy Scriptures. I feel that we in 
our day could benefit from this example.Brilliant, all of them!!! Great Inspirations...I love the "Mormon Messages" videos! I can't wait to see what's next!I was an extra in this clip. AWESOME, AWESOME video!! Thanks for sharing that. I just wish they were all 
transcribed so the subtitles could be more accurate when translated to
