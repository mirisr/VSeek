Apparently the Book of Mormon people called the land their ancestors came 
from "Jerusalem"That was a nice videoMormons are of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints God gave his 
only begotten so that we could live with Heavenly Father (God). Jesus 
Christ died for us on a cross. His hands and feet were nailed to the cross. 
He was wipped. He was supposed to die for us. 3 days later he arose from a 
tomb resurected. While he was on earth he healed the sick and the blind. 
Joseph smith translated the book of Mormon in our days.Why does the Book of Mormon state that Jesus was born in Jerusalem (Alma 
7:10) when history and the Bible state that he was born in Bethlehem 
(Matthew 2:1)?Moroni looks like Moe of the 3 stoogesMoroni traveled for many years across the American continent fleeing for 
his life. He was completely alone. I go to national parks and wonder how 
much the Lord entreated this humble man with visions of the future. what 
kind of visions did he see on the ancient horizons of the land we now live 
in?I love Moroni!! <3These people lived before our time. They wrote the things that God revealed 
to their minds concerning us. They saw our day. It is foolish to mock them, 
or anybody who follows the words. God has always spoken to his children. 
Those who progress are those to obey his word.Universal success in this life is based on tolerance love and respect. If 
we have hatred toward each other then we as a nation will fail.Good presentation to explain the BOMWe give thanks to the prophets who gave their lives so that we could have 
the book of mormon:)
