Wow what a great video, as I am teaching the Gospel Doctrine class as we 
speak this has been a great help even though I have read the book Teaching 
No greater Call several times every time I do I learn more every time  
Thanks Elder Bednar I hope to be half the man you are my friend.  Thanks 
for awakening my soul once again to become a better teacher﻿Wow Elder Bednar truly is my hero. I hope one day to have the wisdom he 
has.﻿The elders in my area recently explained to me one method for getting an 
answer to a personal question from the scriptures. They said to write the 
question on a piece of paper and put the paper in my scriptures, then every 
time I read my scriptures, first read the question and have it on my mind 
as I read. This has helped me resolve important personal matters by 
allowing the Holy Spirit to speak to me while reading the scriptures, 
because I am particularly receptive to it's voice while I read.Elder Bednar really personifies and exemplifies what he is teaching in this 
video. He has learned so much through the Spirit, and has received so much 
light and knowledge that you can tell he knows what he is saying, but not 
of rote memorization, but by personal experience and revelation. THE POWER FOLLOWS THE ACT. The Truth herein is invaluable! This is very 
real, very true stuff!"The role of the teacher is to have gospel truth embedded in his or her 
soul." Elder Bednar mi apóstol favorito.
