Peace and God bless you all.ï»¿I think Jesus wants us to be believe and will provide what we need to do so 
if we're willing. I love the look on His face and the way He touched his 
head as He talked to Thomas.ï»¿To even those who did not believe HE CAME,  and so shall he come again, 
even to those who do not believe.  May we all find strength to believe, 
that his coming may be one of joy.  Believe in him... for as the the father 
of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou 
mine unbelief.  It is up to us, as it was with Thomas, to accept that he is 
the risen Christ.ï»¿JESUS IS GOD!!!! ðŸ™Œï»¿
