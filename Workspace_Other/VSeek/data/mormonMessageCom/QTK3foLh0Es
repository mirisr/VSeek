È uno dei molti modi migliori per iniziare bene la giornata.﻿Is Katherine jenkins a Mormon﻿That was charming﻿Lets be honest they would make a cute couple.YASOU Levendi mou! I always loved & admired you, but what you did here with 
the mormon tabernacle choir, I am speechless! Except to say I now have the 
UTMOST respect for you..& beg you to please keep reaching for higher goals 
because you've proven you've GOT IT in you!All the choir be like, "Shoot. I don't want to sing anymore. I want to 
become a Paso Doble dancer!"Katherine and Mark still receive raves from the DWTS viewers. Warner could 
have built a special around these two but blew it. Never did follow up with 
great following in America Katherine had after the show. ABC didn't though; 
having her back with Placido Domingo on DWTS, and a Nashville Christmas 
show and GMA..Absolutly the most talented Lady with elegance,style and 
grace ever to dance on that showSpanish dancing looks very romantic.Is there anything that Katherine Jenkins does not do well in music - sings, 
dances WOWA beautiful woman, a beautiful voice, a beautiful dancer, and most 
important a beautiful soulAh! I was there! I was so excited when I found out they were going to do 
that! I'm a ballroom dancer myself. I agree she is the best I have ever seen on DWTS I know she is on tour. She 
will be right here in Las Vegas, Nv in the brand new concert hall that was 
built. I think she will be early Nov. But not only is she beautiful 
physically, and talented but she is so down to earth. amazing. One of the World's Sweetest and Classiest Women...IMHO!!!!Great Dancer and Singer....I may be related too. My Mother's maiden name 
was Jenkins!I wish she could come back for season 15! but I think she has singing 
engagements rest of the year. Never be another season to beat season 14 
with her on the show Awesomemaravilloso un buen gusto para los ojos y los oidos.Wow!Qué belleza! Nope That was Cool!!wow she's beautifulme too!!!!!I was there!! =)
