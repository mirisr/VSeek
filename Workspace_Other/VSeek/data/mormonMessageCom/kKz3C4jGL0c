Llenate de fe de amor y servicio a tu progimo. ﻿Pole!  Very nicely done!﻿The least seed of all herbs
Grows up like a tree
It's a home to the birds....
Doubt not your offering﻿Beautiful video. I love the outdoor setting of the framing shots, and the 
dramatizations of the parables make them much easier for students to 
understand. I'm not at all keen on the narrator's voice, which seems 
incongruous and lacks gravitas. But that's a minor quibble. Thank you for a 
very well done video. Each of the latest series of Bible Videos has been 
exemplary.﻿I love the video illustrations shown while Christ is speaking. They make 
His words more immediate and powerful, even in our modern age.﻿I can't wait till all these videos are done and can be put together in the 
utmost chronological order. For now I spiritually fill myself through each 
one and can always go back to get new insight. It's amazing how what Christ 
said to the Jews universally speaks to us from any time.﻿
