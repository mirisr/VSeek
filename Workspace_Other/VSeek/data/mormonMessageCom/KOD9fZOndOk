No matter how many times I listen to these  talks  I feel the Spirit.  If 
you need a break from the world,  listen to these great  Conference talks, 
 they bring peace, rest and  comfort  to the soul.﻿Love this message, it's true. Blessings are beyond measure when we 
demonstrate obedience to Heavenly Father. ﻿Great message.......Thank you. Elder Bednar takes principles I've heard all my life and opens them up to 
an understanding that I did not see before today.
