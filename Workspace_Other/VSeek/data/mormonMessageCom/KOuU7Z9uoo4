sweet not so alone tonight. merry christmas.Welcome Brother, I am a Mormon in Brazil in the last 40 years , be welcome 
and help us there with your new testemony of this great truth !Спасибо, очень душевно.u will find we focus on Christ during this season. we try to do what Christ 
would do. we rely on our usual daily scripture reading. and on the usual 
gift of giving and forgiving. we attend our usual sunday meetings. we 
partake of the sacrament. we do what we do all year around : ) Amei o discurso do presidente Uchtdorf, dar presentes significativos e ser 
gratos por aquilo que tanto recebemos. Amo também as histórias inspiradoras 
do presidente Monson.What beautiful music! The Spirit was strong with those Heavenly voices! The real meaning of gift giving and reasons for giving selflessly .the 1st 
Presidency said this well!Hermoso, me encantó!!!I like the music the best.I LOVE THE LORD& HIS SOHN JESUS CHRIST&PEACE TO THE WORLD,IN THE NAME OF 
THE LORD!(WORLDPEACE)!Such a marvellous experience to watch and follow this devotional!! Even far 
away, the spirit is strong and present!! :) Merry Christmas!!!i recently converted to Mormonism this will be my first christmas as a 
mormon. me gusta el devocional porque son inspiraciones para nosotros , los hijos 
de Dios.
