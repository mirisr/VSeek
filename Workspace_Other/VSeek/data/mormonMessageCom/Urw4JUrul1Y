This is so amazing! Love it so much!! Reminds me so much of God and Jesus!!﻿ E﻿Merry Christmas, a great reminder that the best most selfless gifts are 
free.﻿This video illustrates one of the principles that are near and dear to my 
heart:  that is, that adults can learn from children, as much as we adults 
learn from one another.  Also, it is possible that everyone can have 
friends of all ages.  I am convinced of this because that is what the 
Savior did during His mortal ministry.  So, isn't this an important part of 
leading a righteous life?!    ﻿This. Made me tear up a little.  ﻿Beautiful :-)﻿One of the best messages ever. Very compassionate. Good work. Thank you.﻿We're all down in the dumps sometimes, but being thankful for and sharing 
our many blessings puts us on higher ground.﻿Awesome!﻿We watched the "behind the scenes" of this video this last year. Is that 
still online? We thought it was pretty cool and I'd like to share the link.﻿I love how the man learns that being happy is better than grumpy﻿beautiful, and full of meaning, lets show the christmas spirit﻿Great video﻿
