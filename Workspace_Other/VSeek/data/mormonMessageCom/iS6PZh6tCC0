portrayal of the lives we live as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day saints: ordinary people living an ordinary life and as we do we 
live as best as we can the gospel of Jesus Christ.﻿I love this movie. Did this movie come out in the movies in Australia?﻿I keep watching this over and over, and everytime I can't help but shed 
tears. Such a great movie!! I love it! #Sharegoodness﻿Believe what you want, but it is in our best interest to keep theology off 
of children until they can make the choices on their own.﻿A millions thumbs up to the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter 
Day Saints!!! I love this docu-movie, ever and ever...😄😄😄﻿This is the best!!! I watched this docu-movie last May 2015 during the

Church. It's not propaganda. I recommend anyone who is curious about the 
Church check it out.﻿you should make an education help Center for kids in school to attract 
other people to reunite with their heavenly father.﻿I really love this movie <3﻿I've been a Mormon 30 years and served a mission. While the folks 
highlighted in this movie are quite spectacular, I think the British 
documentary version of "Meet the Mormons" is much more accurate to the 
everyday Mormon experience (and especially missionary life)﻿the story that hit me the most is the Armstrong family because my family 
just put a missionary out﻿This is an amazing film about the beautiful gospel of Jesus Christ. I am a 
member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and I would 
recommend to anyone that wants to know about what I believe to see this 
film. The families in this film share wonderful stories of faith and the 
importance of family.﻿Hi Moran channel ,
I don't really have a religion but as I grew up I went to catholic churches 
and I already had my baptism and first communion but I don't feel right. 
I've always loved the mormon religion so please don't hate me. Can I become 
a mormon? an how if so. do you have to be a certain nationality? because my 
parents are Mexican but I was born in the us. with lots of love MARLY <3﻿Just an amazing film and so inspiring!! :) I love to follow Jesus Christ 
and try to master this life! :)﻿I love this movie every time I watch this I learn something new. I get 
really emotional because I  feel the spirit. thanks be to god﻿Great people. So glad the Church has numerous such people.﻿I'm an atheist (well, agnostic atheist) but I do reckon LDS culture is 
quite beautiful. I like a lot of the values and motifs I see.﻿Thank you so much for uploading this to Youtube! What a great movie!﻿AWESOME!!! So happy that this is on Youtube!!!﻿So inspiring. Thanks for uploading this movie, I'm grateful that I've been 
able to see it.﻿It couldn't get any better. Proud to be a Mormon!!!!!﻿After all good things said about this video, I also want to thank you for

glare of media driven prejudices and animosity! Mormons rock...I know, 
because I am one! Yeah !!! :D﻿I may not go to church every Sunday but this is a good movie to see with 
your family and friends﻿I enjoyed watching this movie, about these Families lives stories from 
complete different parts of the World, and very different Cultures and up 
bringing, and yet come into harmony in one common Faith. To God be the 
Glory.﻿Good Movie!﻿Buenísimo! A great contribution helping clarify wrong concepts about 
Mormons. Thanks a lot!﻿Very moving and and a wonderful contrast of individuals.﻿This was a cute little doco. I love getting to know people with inspiring 
stories even if it is 'remotely' via films such as this.

I wonder though, if you do a follow up could you make it less 
America-centric? There are almost 200 countries in the world. You'll find 
Mormons in many of them.﻿I am happy !! I am member of the Church of Jesus Christ of later day Saints﻿Great video!!!!
: )﻿Thank you for sharing it with the world, haven't seen it but I have the 
feeling that today I will have the best lunch break of the week!﻿Had some emotional stories and was quite informative but I think it 
honestly only really touched the surface, it didn't go into any details 
about doctrine or where they get their beliefs from, kind of just made it 
look like Mormons believe the same things most other Christians believe 
which is not at all true, but it was still good to see some insight into 
some of their worlds.﻿I'll send this on to others. The message is universally Christian. I have 
sold suits to lots of young men preparing to go on their missions, and have 
always been impressed with their sincerity, gentle nature, good manners and 
maturity. They practice LOVE the way Christ and the Apostles intended. The 
movie is well worth your time. Remember, we're all in this together.﻿I've been waiting for this opportunity for so long, thank you very much for 
uploading it here....I loved this movie from watching its trailer few 
months back...absolutely a must share with my friends,﻿Thank you for providing this excellent resource online. I'm hoping a friend 
will use this to introduce her family to our beliefs so they will all feel 
comfortable accepting my invitation to come to church this Sunday to hear 
me speak on "How we can strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ".﻿Watched this on movie night at my ward. enjoyed it very much with the 
sisters and brothers and the kids that came to view. really happy to see it 
on youtube so I can watch repeatedly. I have been a member of the Church 
for nearly a year now and I can truly say it is the best decision I have 
ever made in this life. His Love Never Fails.﻿Great video. Mormons have the complete restored gospel of Jesus Christ. 
Take a listen and spend some time looking into it. This message could 
change your life.﻿Glad to see this on YouTube finally. This shows Mormons like they really 
are!﻿LOVED This!!!!! I even cried! thank you for making this available for 
anyone to see!﻿Yes!!! Very inspiring!﻿Me encanto esta pelicula, pero lo mas importante es que otras personas 
mejor dicho que mis miles de hermanos puedan saber de esto, que Dios es 
nuestro padre, que nos ama, que vive , que trata por muchos medios que le 
conoscamo y que este uno de ellos. No inmagino mi vida sin su influencia o 
mejor dicho sin su amor, su guia... Creo que he sido altamente bendecido 
por haberle conocido, hago eco de las palabras del herfmano de Nepal no soy 
perfecto pero si soy perfecto en mi intento de lograr el maximo potencial 
que el tiene para mi... llegar a vivir en su presencia por eternidad en 
eternidad:)﻿See they are normal!﻿I love this movie so much !!!!﻿Golly, when that man said he loved Brother Halvorsen, I melted. What a 
great man. What a youth.﻿I love this movie it is spectacular and i'm not just saying that because

Father in Heaven and is a manifestation of the Grace and unconditional love

started showing in the theaters, I didn't want to see it. I didn't like the 
trailers for it and didn't think it would be any good, even though I am a 
member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. My husband 
wanted to see it though, so I went with him to see it and I was glad that I 
went. Thanks to all who were involved in the making of the movie, and thank 
you for posting the movie here. : )﻿i am proud mormon member, all of my family members are mormon! love u all!﻿i love this movie so much!

later. He lives today. I am Christian. I am Mormon. I love the last story 
in this film. It made me tear up. With God all things are possible!:)﻿I love this movie. its so powerful!﻿I'm a brand new Mormon and hope one day to go on a mission. Such a 
beautiful movie!﻿Yeah I can finally watch this is the UK and for free xx﻿WOW! fantastic to watch! I loved each one of the stories but the one that 
touched me the most was about the Mom, Dawn Armstrong. What a survivor and 
a great Mom! Thank you Mormon Channel. We are going to watch this video on 
Monday's Family Home Evening.....﻿This doesn't have the bonus story does it?﻿Glorious!﻿i'm a mormon, i was a missionary and i'm a happy man... :)﻿I just love it so much <3﻿Coincidentally, this film was released amid a huge PR firestorm of their 
policy changes in regard to same sex relationships.﻿
