I love this. I remember one time when I was feeling very down and I was on 
the swings at a nearby park and I thought of this story, starting at 1:15 
and I thought about how amazing it was and I looked up and my stake 
president was walking toward me, following his little grandchild. He said 
"hello, how are you doing?" and i choked but got out "good" and he said, 
"well I think you can be a little better. What's wrong?" and we talked a 
little, it was a really neat experience.
