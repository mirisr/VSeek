" lol and you still believe a 3000+ year book " My reply: God is same 
today, yesterday, and forever...I stoped reading, couldent handle this 
level of stupid.Good stuff!wow just chilling what is the name of the actor who plays Jesus?Here's a tip: if you don't want to see videos about religion steer clear of 
the Mormon Channel.I believe jesus christ is the only true christ and I'm ready to meet him 
and walk with him , serve him Beautiful! So profound the things my Lord says, how sad for those who 
reject and ridicule him and his work for them; and us. Much love and thanks 
LordBeautiful. The spirit of this video is so movingWhat a great film! Our Savior Jesus Christ! :)they do such a great job with the costumes!Religion...eerrghh!They look like a bunch of muslim. Hats beard and islamic thobesTo all, let pray to God directly.. like how jesus pray.. ask God to guide, 
protect n forgive us...God is one, he alone worth to be worship. If human wana worship to human, 
thy shoud worship to adam coz he hav no father n mother.. Once you believe 
adam is sent by God, why you cnt accept Jesus is frm God too? God is fair 
enough not to eng His prophet's life on cross.. Trinity is does not make 
any senses... Memang xmasuk akal laaa wehhhh... Bertaubat lah sblm kiamat..the true is that the Lord's love is going to beyond that we can do but 
always we must to do his words until our last days So wonderful... I so needed to see this.A nicely reconstructed and reenactment of the life and words of Jesus.muchas Gracias por estos videos°° I love the videos posted by the Mormon Channel. You can definitely feel the 
Spirit.
