truly beautiful.﻿Merry Christmas!﻿I am not a Mormon, I'm not even religious, but you cannot deny this joy.

direction of Leonard Bernstein.﻿It's heavenly beautiful. Praise the Lord. Merry Christmas Everyone. ﻿ O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels;

Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above .
Glory to God glory in the Highest;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,

Congratulations from a French musician﻿nice﻿it could not be described as anything, but the most wonderful thing my ears 
have heard in a LONG time!I really enjoyed it very uplifting. glen johnsonGreat singers. Thanks for the beautiful music. I feel sorry for the Mormons 
when they find out the truth. The good news is it is not too late for them 
if they pick up a Bible and read that their prophet Joseph Smith is not 
even mentioned. Praying for all you Mormons:-)na sialua himai!!!Goosebumps The song is great. But the people are funny.
