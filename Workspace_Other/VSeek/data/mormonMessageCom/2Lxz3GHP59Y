Anything can change.
﻿This is why, regardless of what you think, we need religion.

It's a strong, personal relationship between you and God, and that 
relationship creates a profound drive to take anywhere you want. Your only 
limits are what you make of them, push your limits, push yourself to do 
things you think you couldn't do, and you'll be surprised at how rewarding 
life truly is.﻿I can't believe 8 people disliked this video :'( ﻿What a great story and testimony. It is really inspirational!﻿Awesome message of hope and change. I always keep a picture of the temple
