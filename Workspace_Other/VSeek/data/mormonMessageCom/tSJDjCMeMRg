I am are singing this song with a choir in a Temple Ordinance Worker's 
Fireside. I use this choir's performance on You Tube to practice, and often 
I'm brought almost to tears because of the special spirit this choir brings 
to the song. I can only hope we can sing with the power and conviction 
these beautiful young women bring to the song. Thanks, Young Women. Thanks, 
Sally DeFord.ï»¿So beautiful! Thank you to everyone who performed this song. I love it! Too lovelybonitas voces que el padre celestial os cuide a cada una de todas vosotras This a real nice sing to listen to while eating lunch at work.
