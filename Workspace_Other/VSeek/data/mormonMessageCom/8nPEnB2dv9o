﻿5th﻿Amen, sister!﻿Sharon your story is beautiful. I am so glad you were willing to open up 
about the physical abide you suffered as a child and how it affected your 
faith and how you were angry with God. 
My favorite part of your story was when you found the true freedom and 
peace by finally letting go of the life you once lived. To no longer look 
back with longing. 
Stopped white knuckling and LET GO. 
You are a beautiful soul and I felt your love of recovery and God through 
this video! 
Thank you.﻿Sharon, thanks for telling your story. Thanks for helping others by telling 
what it was like, what happened, and what it's like now. As a fellow 
recovering addict, thanks for what you said about Step 3 -- learning to 
trust God. That was my turning point. And then, letting Him help me! God 
bless you, sister,﻿can't make a good enough comment to give good enough thanks for this. What 
I felt while watching this was the spirit. This is where I'm at, where that 
sister used to be. She's an inspiration to me. Please make more of these AR 
inspired videos!! They speak to me better than just about anything in the 
gospel lol :)﻿
