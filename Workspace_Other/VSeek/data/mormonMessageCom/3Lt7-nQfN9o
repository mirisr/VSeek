Who are the nine people who dislike this video?ï»¿Actually this video is a symbolic of the nature of man to an all serving 
God. He being our Heavenly Father is willing and able to serve His children 
at all times. I don't believe this boy is being disrespectful or 
disobedient. He simply wants the love and attention of his father. I am a devout, active LDS. I am also a licensed marriage, family therapist. 
I believe in proper parenting & patience. This video is too much! Children 
need strict bedtime & proper boundaries. The child has too much freedom to 
be in control of the parents. The father is not setting proper boundaries - 
when it is appropriate to call and when it's not. Improper boundaries as a 
child produces teenagers & adults that feel entited who can get their way 
any time, anywhere. It encourages disobedience.Holy cow! I did a video similar to this three weeks ago!how does this have anything to do with mormonism?I want a husband like him!My favorite!!! Shows how no matter what we still gotta be humble towards 
our children :)i 2nd that Amen :Pthis is my favorite one! :Dlove it i love this video, being a mormon is awesome!So cute! I love these videos! <333
