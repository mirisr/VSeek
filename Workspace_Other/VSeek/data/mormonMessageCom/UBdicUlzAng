Thank you for your testimony as it strengthens mine, Glory to God the 
Almighty and Jesus Christ our Saviour﻿The Bible and Book of Mormon Testify of Jesus he is the Christ don't be 
confused by the anti-christ ! Do not Worry Jesus has overcome the world and 
false religions of satan they only hurt and persecute the Truth !﻿Life is full of twists and turns with unexpected bumps, but the rough 
patches are meant to help us grow. These rough patches allow us to be more 
faithful to God. Faith does not mean trusting God to stop the storm, but 
trusting Him to strengthen us as we walk through the storm. Thank you for 
sharing your testimony. Today I see the beauty in all things!Through no man I know this but the Father that is in Heaven has revealed 
this to me that Jesus is the Christ, His Only Begotten in the flesh. He 
came for me; He came for all!Beautiful and well witnessed, this is why Jesus Died, so that we could have 
victory over addictions and freedom from worries and chains. Jesus saves 
and thats for sure, look at this woman, jesus sees her as beautiful as me, 
and i know how beautiful the king is, My God in meGloryyyyyyyy TO GODDDDDDDD :-)Twenty-seven years is a long time To try to "do this life" alone But 
through the Book of Mormon I find The way to Christ that it makes known 
Today I can look in the mirror And feel God's love, superior "Today I want 
everyone to see What the Lord has done with me!"My husband abandoned me And I took a long journey I had children to take 
care of But, strength alone I'd not enough Soon I became a drug addict With 
power to explode For what I sought to self inflict Took me down a hard road 
I never looked in the mirror For had become something ugly Then, one day I 
knelt in terror Wanting to end my life of drugging He led me down a path of 
peace Found in a simple scripture The words: "Seek and you shall find" did 
please And for more I did venture
