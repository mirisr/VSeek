Rique is a real man. Many more fortunate people could learn volumes from 
his example.@macaroniwater Believe me, by far most of the good things that happen in 
the Church of Jesus Christ are done in private. And if the Church somehow 
loses its eternal reward for this very donation, so be it.what about the scripture that says to do good works in private or the 
blessings you receive are the attention you get? Verily verily I say unto 
you...they have their reward.TITHING BRINGS MIRACLEShow does somebody give this a thumbs down?! GREAT STORY!!!Onya Rique....go you good thing....The Lords hand is stretched out stillIt makes me so proud to be a part of such a wonderful Church!My heart goes out to him.Isn't it wonderful to see how the Church is responding and helping others. 
I was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on 
April 19, 2009. I have never known such joy in my life. How magnificent 
this gospel is.i love paying my tithes.. ^^ I love the church.. so much.. its been a great 
blessing in me being baptized to the church of Jesus Christ of latter day 
saints..Very cool!
