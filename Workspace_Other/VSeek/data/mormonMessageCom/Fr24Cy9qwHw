My faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaavorite!!!!!!!ï»¿It is what we name "Sing with one accord", when more than 21.000 
(Congregation plus the Mormon Tabernacle Choir) sing this magnificent hymn 
of praise "Come, Ye children of the Lord" ... Wow, it's awesome!I love this Hymn, Funny enough when i saw the chorister for the song i 
decided i would conduct like him if i ever got asked to cover for our 
chorister in our branch here in Aotearoa lol. I love General Conference, 
Alot of people don't realise that our conferences have alot of comedy value 
in them aswell as spiritual upliftment. I can remember learning this hymn when I was in primary and we met on 
Tuesday afternoons.I also love to hear the traditional hymns and anthems. Praise the Lordi love this song i sing along with it every time i play itLove when this choir sings the tradional hymns. this song is awesome!this song is awesome@Licleonschakal I like your idea, for millions to sing this song. 21,000 
plus the Tabernacle Choir is good, but millions would be even better!It's so lovely. Thanks for posting. This is "a good thing."I LOVE THIS HYMN! *-*(literally) millions of members all over the world were singing this hymn 
at the same time, Oh what love will then bear sway, When our fears shall 
flee away!!
