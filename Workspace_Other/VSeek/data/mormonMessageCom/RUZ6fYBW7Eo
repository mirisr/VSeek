This is so beautiful. Thanks!﻿Singing in this choir was one of the highlights of my life. I love this 
arrangement.﻿Beautiful.....Thank you so much﻿Дороги Пастыря сердцу!!!﻿That was beautiful! Are Christians the only group or  faith that sing hymns 
of praise in a choir...do other religions sing as they do?﻿The extra lyrics! Wish they were in the hymnbook.﻿Beautiful... :-)So much hope in this Hymn, each and every one has a deep messege, we are 
all hungry and helpless and cold, and somehow, our dear Father finds time 
to leave the 99 to find the wanderer. simply AmazingSo epicIm a mormon
