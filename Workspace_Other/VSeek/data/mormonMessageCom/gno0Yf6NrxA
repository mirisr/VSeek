these are awesome.﻿these videos are great now as i read the scriptures i have a better of idea 
of the story's﻿Alma and his companion Amulek must have been disgusted after watching those 
Zoramites up on the Rameumptom preaching blasphemy. during the time this 
was going on the Zoramites were letting in the rich into their meetings and 
excommunicating the poor. this lesson teaches we can worship anytime 
anywhere and we should have faith in God. it also teaches us we should care 
for the poor.     ﻿. : i did not know there was a channel of scriptures w/VIDEOS!! :"D 
thank-you thank-u:*). : zoramites are the bene of israel? -- please, let me know : : thank you

Zomamites especially
