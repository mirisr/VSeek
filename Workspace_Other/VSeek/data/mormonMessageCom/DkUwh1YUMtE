So very beautiful!﻿Awesome﻿I really love this message!!!!﻿Beautiful message. ﻿OH MY goodness WHAT a beautiful Message 😍👏😱﻿this is wonderfull i have a sister at home my self﻿No it is never too late to convert :D x I grew up with this Man being the Prophet. Most of my life he was the 
Prophet. He is someone that I will always look up to. What a great example 
of Love, Kindness, faithfulness, and humor. He was a remarkable husband and 
father and priesthood holder. I love his example of the way he treated 
everyone he came in contact with. ;)What an amazing man with an amazing message. Thank God for mothers. The women in my life <3 They make me happier than I could ever be. They 
bring me closer to God than I ever would be without them. Thank you for 
this message.He was such a great man, and this is such an awesome message! May God bless 
the women in our lives!If you want to find out more about the church, I can help you. :) There are 
a lot more amazing messages on this channel. :)I am not a mormon. But mormon or not, Women in our lives are precious from 
mother to sisters to friends to colleagues to wife to daughters. We cannot 
offend women without offending God, what a wonderful message. God bless all 
righteous souls no matter which sect or church they belong. In the eyes of 
God we all are same and judged by our righteousness. And everyday I try to 
be a righteous man. :)me too.well (in my opinion) you have feminism to thank for that. A great man once 
said, "if chivalry died, feminism killed it". many men do not display the 
same chivalry that once was expected of us, and feminism has played a major 
role with how men treat women, because how women expect to be treated has 
been changing. I am one who tries to show women that kind of respect, like 
holding a door open, or some other little thing that (to me) shows respect, 
but some women actually hate that kind of chivalryWe live in a society that teaches women to 1. stand up for themselves & be 
counted. 2.be loud to be heard. A society that says we 3. Women can & 
should do anything a man can! I'm here to say that it's easy to fall prey 
to those voices with a small portion of truth. I'm finding that in order to 
be a true follower of Christ, I need to refine my character & have more 
charity, softer tones, & less control. A truly refined woman balances her 
life & love with her spouse & gives her will to God's.This made me cry! What a sweet man!That is an amazing dream. :) You have high values, and that will do you 
very well! I hope that things are going well for you in that respect. P.S. 
For one who thinks that their English is bad, let me tell you that you 
write it down far better than many people that I know. ;)Good advice "do not settle". I'm glad my wife didn't settle and waited for 
me! :)I love how the brethren speak of improvement to the brethren, and the 
sisters of improvement to the sisters. Both encourage the other, though, 
and acknowledge their importance. This being said, as a woman, I know my 
place is to continue to be righteous in my own, to work to earn the trust 
and respect of a man who will be worthy to take me to the temple. I know 
that women must respect men, as we expect men to respect us. It is ALWAYS 
two ways. Please don't think that. You just have to find the right one. I used to 
think all women were the same (not in a good way) then I met my wife. We've 
been together 13 years now. And we'll be together for time and eternity.I truly believe that we women are as equal to men but more important the 
loard does defend his daughters he loves us so much that when he died and 
Resurrection he appeared himself to women first and that is written it 
shows that we too make the biggest part in his kingdom girls don't ever 
feel low because some guy thinks hes hot and superior you are just as 
beautiful as them we are all made in his image and his image is full of 
beauty we all are beautiful in our own way.Having gender roles is not being sexist. Being sexist would be saying that 
the responsibilities that men have are more important than the 
responsibilities that women have. This video is doing the very opposite. It 
is saying that a man and a woman compliment each other, the way God 
intended. It is saying that women are just as important as men. That 
doesn't sound sexist to me at all. Also, if you don't like what you hear, 
you don't have to watch it or believe in it. Simple as that.I can speak from experience that there are men out there that do not act 
the way you described. I am fortunate enough to have a few men in my life 
(including my husband) who are examples of what a man should be. There is 
an example of such a man in this very video. Do not settle. You will find a 
man that is right for you and holds you higher than himself. With that 
said, do not have the expectation that you will find a perfect man, because 
he does not exist in this life.I understand the challenges of finding a good mate and during my time in 
Young men's I was probably guilty of coming off this way, but I know that I 
felt as hurt by some of the mean things that were done to me by girls. The 
best advice that I can give you is to not worry about it yet remember you 
are still dealing with boy and not with full grown men. That special man is 
out there he might not be all that he needs to be yet.You should check out "Dayton's Legs" It's super cool and inspirational. I 
hope it moves you! I've had a hard time lately, Young Women's lessons say to be married and 
have children. Not that I have a problem with that, I want a happy marriage 
and children. It's them men. Every guy I meet looks down on women, thinking 
themselves superior. If that's how all men are, I won't get married. Simple 
as that.Such a beautiful message, that inspires me to appreciate them even 
more......I miss Hinckley!!!Sadly, the women in my life are not like this at all. They are deceitful, 
cunning, adulterous and cruel. Would to God I had a woman like as described 
in this video. I honor those who are like this and wait to find one. Till 
then I I believe there must be women like Pres. Hinckley describes and I 
thank God for them.I will never disrespect another woman for the rest of my life. I was 
arrogant but now this message tells you to be compassionate and to 
appreciate where you came from. Varities of religion are the reasons why we 
can express these messages and get the same effect on them. I know now that 
they are the key to the lock, without them there would be no house, there 
would be no family."Neither is the man without the woman and neither is the 
woman without the man" .... Man that'll stay with me forever.@owningyourfinances :) congrats she will bring great joy into your life@Lcpure Rom1:16 The gospel has been restored once again in these 
latter-days and it is the power of God unto salvation to all those that 
believeth... Matt24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in 
all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. 
The time to seek to know the truth is now... We can be slaves to our own 
ignorance. Beware of pride... The voice of warning is to all people. This 
is not just another religion or church. This is the work of God@musicsnextbigthing Rom1:16 Our message is that the gospel of Christ has 
been restored in these latter-days Eph5:23 Christ is the head of The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints... John17:3 it is very important that 
we all gain a testimony of Jesus Christ and the restoration through the 
power and gift of the Holy Ghost who is a member of the Godhead. We believe 
that the gift of the Holy Ghost can only be received through the power and 
authority of God and by the laying on of hands.@natcheche Eph 5:23@jedbrinton :) she will... Eph 5:23 Love her as Christ loves the church and 
she will:) Together as a family unit you can both seek to know the love of 
God. @RTTK9 Eph5:23 women are compared to the church...that says 
alllllloooottttt:) I dont think that I will ever feel worthy of my lovely 
wife who is truly a daughter of God. I will spend the rest of my life 
trying to love her as Christ loves me...@butterflie2484 Eph5:23 Rom1:16 Matt6:33 Seek not the vain things of this 
world... Seek to know the truth. I know that Presient Hinkley was a man of 
God and that the gospel of Christ has been restored once again in these 
latter-days.@giveitlife Amen. I feel the same way about Wilford Woodruff:) im also a 
convert... It is the knowledge of the truth that will set the world free. 
Prov2:1-5 I know that i have a great desire to change and be obedient to 
the commandments of God... and it is the power of God that has brought this 
mighty change in my heart:) I have felt the love of God and I know that the 
gospel of Christ has been restored once again in these latter-days. I say 
this in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen@natcheche You are very open minded and a great example for everyone!he is very right they are very special. i mean god didnt rip out the womens 
rib to make us. he loved her so much he ripped a guys rib out. haha cheers 
to all those beautiful daughters of our heavenly father! i'd give a rib for 
yaEveryone in the world should hear this sound advise from a man of God.@legoboych86 Not was. He is. :)He and his wife look alike! Pres Hinckley is my favorite prophet. I am so 
blessed to have been born into the church and I am so blessed to be a 
divine young woman. My personal progress coordinator presented me with my 
honor bee today at church and told me that she thinks of me when she is 
looking through the personal progress book. She also said that she thinks 
i'm a perfect young woman. I don't know where that came from, but I am so 
blessed to have this gospel in my life!@legoboych86 All of our prophets are.This is a message that the world needs to hear....very powerful and 
beautiful!As a recent convert (2 1/2 months) my heart is saddened by the fact that I 
never got to hear this man speak. But when I hear these past messages of 
his, my testimony of the trueness of this Church is confirmed. It is my 
testimony that Gordon B. Hinckley was a Prophet of God. That Thomas S. 
Monson is the current Prophet and that this church is the true church. I 
say this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.I can't wait to meet President Hinkley in the Celestial Kingdom.I am not mormon, but this is just a beautiful message, almost brought tears 
to my eyes.I miss him terribly. Just hearing his voice brings tears to my eyes. I know 
without a shadow of doubt that he is a man of God. What an inspiration to 
everyone in the world. :)Pres. Hinkley reminds me so much of my grandpa(:I cried when I watched this.i love these and could watch these for hours on endSomeone I know is in this video!!!!! It's such a good video!!!I know that Thomas S Monson is a prophet of God as was Joseph Smith and 
Gordon B Hinckley. These messages are great and really uplift me. RM1:57 is the cutest couple ever!!I just love President Hinckley. I love how he clearly states that men and 
women are equal in the gospel. I don't know how some people can argue this, 
when it comes straight from the prophet. This is the true church of Jesus 
Christ. I know this with all my heart.I Love it! Thank you so much for posting this beautiful message from our 
late prophet Gordon B. Hinckley. Such a great message from a great man of 
god about the women and their important role in the plan of happiness :)the message of late pres. hinckley its touches a lot.... i really miss my 
children... i really miss when we together go to church, participating in 
sunday school lesson and missing terribly when our time to pray together. 
When my children kidnap my parent and not allowed me to see them, due to 
the reasons that persecuting the righteousness regarding our church (LDS) 
its really break my heart, and hurts but i know heavenly father guided me 
and my children... and i know someday we will be again I would just like to say that Gordon B. Hinckley was a prophet of our 
Heavenly Father who loves us all and that All women are daughters of God 
and we are neither better or worse then the Men. We both should be treated 
as equals just as God wanted. Really love this message!!!!I am very excited to hear this! Thank you!This message makes me feel special. Yes we all are daughters of God.. and 
He loves us...where are the fathers,,, the fathers in our lives,,, adam was the first man 
on the earth,,, jesus christ was lived walking on the earthI'm proud to be married to such a wonderful companion:-) Looking over her 
life she inspires me.I just started dating a wonderful girl - President Hinckley's message is so 
true. She teaches and inspires me every day. I especially love the story of 
how Sister Hinckley appreciated President Hinckley giving her "wings to 
fly" - hopefully someday my future wife will say that about me!I cried for the first time. Its been so long since i haventI missed him too... Im proud to be a mormon...I do miss him too... (T_T)I miss him and his messages! I love you President Hinckley.very uplifting messageWe believe in God our Heavenly Father. We believe in our Savior Jesus 
Christ, His only begotten Son. We believe in the Holy Ghost/Spirit, the 
same which descended as a dove. As far as I know, if you say you are a 
christian you must believe this same thing. If I believe it and you believe 
it how can you have proven otherwise?I love and miss you terribly President Hinkley.i love the information and the feelings of understanding and pure desires 
to see and be seen this wayThis video hits it right on the head. It makes me miss President Hinkley so 
much.I <3 Gordon B. Hinkley Steady and Sure w/ Pre. Monson!i dont understand all that mormons believe in! i am a christian person and 
get told all of the time that mormons believe the same thing i do but i 
have proved them all otherwise! im just really confused about your religion 
thats all!I miss Prophet HinckleyThis is one of the many reasons that I belong to this church.What a beautiful message that says so simply and beautifully how important 
our dear sisters, wives, mothers and daughters are to us!I miss President Hinckley. He was so awesome. I remember when he delivered 
this address. What a masterpiece.It's good to hear these words. Its like a safe haven for me these days. 
Kids these days are the most depressing thing ive ever seen. They are so 
confused about religion, that they leave their faith. You cant even mention 
God openly in school anymore. You cant put down someone elses "religion" or 
beliefs but everyone else can verbally abuse the living sanity right outta 
you, just for being a christian. Pray for them. Pray for the adolescent.Loved this video. Great showing of a diversity of women and 
backgrounds...what a beautiful imagery of the many women who make this 
world a better place.What an inspirational, purely beautiful message!This is great, I love it! Rating 5/5I'm grateful for all the wonderful women in my life--who inspire me and 
nurture my soul!So thankful to be a member of a church that values women in a way that the 
world simply does not!Paul is so often misquoted in a way that appears to mean that men are 
superior to women. I am so thankful for modern day prophets and apostles 
who have time and time and time again set the record straight that even 
though men and women have different roles one is not greater than the 
other. No woman should ever question her worth. The Lord has made it very 
clear through modern revelation that women are not second class citizens in 
his kingdom!Im greatful that in all the terrible media in the world we can still find 
inspiring things such as this. Thank you.In a world where women are being abused, neglected, and even ensalved, this 
video should be shown on every TV screen, theater screen, and every 
computer screen, every 10 minutes!! Thanks, Pres. Hinckley 8-)He always brought a tear to my eye. We miss you brother. I am grateful for 
all the women in my life, and especially my mother, and will be for my wife.I miss President Hinckley so much! I am so thankful to be a woman and for 
all of the women in my life and for women everywhere. Ours is a hard long 
road sometimes.muio bom esse video .gratos somos por elas, nesse plano de felicidadeI am happy to be part of this church... this TRUE church! President 
Hinckley is such an inspiration to all of us. We ARE all equals!!"You cannot offent her (a woman) without offending Him (Heavenly Father)." 
What a beautiful statement!
