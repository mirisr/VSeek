God Himself became man in Christ ( John 1:1,14). Merry Christmas to all. ﻿I love the rendition of Silent Night playing in the back round of the whole 
video.. also, side not of curiousity, do you think they have bloopers for 
the bible videos? haha. I see how spiritually strong the vids are, but I 
don't know, just food for thought, I guess.﻿What a wonderful way, to bring back to mind, the real story of Christmas, 
and the real meaning of this sacred holiday!! The world would be so 
different, if all mortals everywhere, could grasp hold of this concept: 
 and make it an important part of their lives and their testimony.
God lives; so does His son, Jesus Christ; and so will all of us, one day, 
if we believe, with our whole heart,....
Thank you, Joe Charbel, you are awesome, what you say is very awesome!! ﻿This is the greatest time of year read Luke chapter 2:and pray about it﻿I'm thankful for the savior's and his greatest gift he has given to 
mankind, his atonement.  Without it, we wouldn't be able to learn, grow, 
and progress in our self-development to become like him. ﻿I didn't know jesus or mary was from england﻿Me parece fantástico. Estos vídeos representa realmente el espíritu de la 
navidad.﻿This is beautiful﻿This is beautiful ﻿
