Thank you for the timely reminder that we need to communicate with God 
daily, and asked and it will be given. 

May God bless all in the new year.

specifically in times of need in my life. This video really spoke to me 
directly. I'm thankful to be LDS and I'm thankful for our leaders. And I am 
most thankful for Jesus Christ, and for a loving Heavenly Father who speaks 
to all of us, calling us from the dark corners of life in which we may find 
ourselves sometimes. I BEAR MY TESTMONEY THAT THE CHURCH IS TRUE AND THAT IF YOU PRAY TO YOUR 
HAVENLY FATHER THAT HE WILL ANSWEAR YOUR PRAY AND HE IS THERE TO TALK TO 
WEN YOU NEED HIM AND ALSO HE ALLWAYS THERE 2 SUPPORT YOU YOU ALL 100% AND I 
LEAVE IN THY NAME OF jESUS cHRIST AMEN.A wonderful talk that I needed to hear. I'm learning to rely on Heavenly 
Father daily and not worrying about the future so much. He is there and 
willing to help, so long as you are willing to ask.thank you for sharing that beautiful message....Greetings from Mexico.This is an excellent video I will be watching this many times it will help 
me succeed in life.Wise words... Daily Bread...This is exactly what I needed to hear at this time in my life..I've recently changed my prayers from specific to like Elder Christofferson 
speaks of, like The Savior does. Let thy will be done and it's been the 
most enlightening and enriching thing I've ever done.My take home message from the first part is : PRAY ALWAYS. Talk to our 
Heavenly Father.
