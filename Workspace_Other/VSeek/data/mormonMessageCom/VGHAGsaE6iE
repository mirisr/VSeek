This talk is so inspirational! I'm 19, and my papers just got sent off to 
Salt Lake. I'll be hearing back hopefully in about 2-3 weeks. I've never 
felt more excitement and anticipation for anything in my entire life.President Rasband was my Mission President in the NYNYN Mission. He is a 
great man and a role model to me. I love these men, they even admit to their mistakes at times. haha its 
awesome to know that they speak the truth and at the same time, aren't 
conceded or prideful about their position.Amazing talk :)I can wait to serve as a sister missionary, 5 more yearsto go!!!! :)
