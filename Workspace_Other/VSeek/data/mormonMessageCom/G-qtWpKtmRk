Deists and Theists can show scientific evidence for their beliefs because 
of the science of Biogenesis (life comes only from living things, which can 
be logically and mathematically reverse engineered to the Creator of Life). 
Atheists and evolutionists cannot show any scientific evidence for their 
claim of Abiogenesis (spontaneous generation) or Lamarckism (gradual 
changes of one species into another different species). Therefore atheists 
and evolutionists fail the tests of science. True. As a tech expert, I pray first then act...mind and heart in a 
peaceful coexistence.Hmm where did the science come from. The Holy Ghost is the spirit of truth, 
all truth. As we learn all things are spiritual.In the last 200 years what we call technology started out as improvements. 
People's minds were not ready for all the advances in the world. No they 
were not prayed into existence, but it is almost as if a door was opened to 
allow these kinds of thoughts to come to our minds. Yes, Da Vincci designed 
flying machines, but people thought he was crazy. All these things have 
come to pass because of God's great blessings.
