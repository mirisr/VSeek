6 people are too prideful to listen to this message BEWARE OF PRIDE Love listening to these talks :-)@246Alexandrea well, these are hard things to address on youtube. seek the 
counsel of your Bishop or Branch President, or if your husband is 
uncomfortable with that see a marriage or personal counsellor. Remeber that 
Christs Atonement is available to all of us for MANY things, including our 
sorrows whether because of our mistakes or the mistakes of others. He loves 
you and will guide you through these things. i feel so humbled with this message so opposite from what i and my children 
are experiencing everyday in my own home from the father who holds the 
Priesthood. all these years i never heard him say " i am sorry" nor call me 
by name. whenever he is angry for reason of no worth he would shout at me. 
i stayed only because of my children..please somebody help me..Thank you President Uchtdorf for the great message. I need it.Best talk on pride that I have ever heard! So needed!"We don't discover humility by thinking less of ourselves; we discover 
humility by thinking less about ourselves." This is the best talk I have heard in a long time. Straight talk. Easy to 
understand. Directed by the spirit. Thank You President Uchtdorf. Just my opinion, but this was the best talk of the Conference. It truly hit 
home for me. A great man, very well spoken.
