This message is part of a broader message from a video called Special 
Witnesses of Christ where the Prophet and Apostles of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-Day Saints at the time released (2000). Thomas S. Monson 
was featured twice in the film I believe. At the time Gordon B. Hinckley 
was President of the Church."I bear an apostolic witness that Jesus is the savior of the world." His 
testimony of Heavenly Father answering the prayer of a dying man through 
the scriptures isn't personal enough for you? This is a man who hears God. 
Of course Jesus saves him, but his apostolic witness is about more than 
himself.That is odd. I thought I would hear his personal testimony. No mention of 
how Jesus saved him or changed his life.
