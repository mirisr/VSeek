Happy Family! ï»¿my mom has 9 kidsï»¿That baby is awesome. *Nods off in chair* .... *snaps awake* "What? What'd 
I miss?"ï»¿This family inspires me. ï»¿Lol, I wonder the same thing about the 40min process of getting dressed in 
the mornings :)ï»¿Me encantoo !! I loved !! :') ï»¿A great family! Would you also read the Friend or scriptures too? Do your 
children pray and read scriptures in the morning at first? Just wondering 
what I can do in the morning. Thanks! ï»¿D'awww. How sweet. ï»¿This family makes me so happy! Well done on the cinematography as well!!ï»¿my 6 yr old made herself some "tags" after watching this video! :-) 
Uplifting and inspiring.ï»¿The video series "Happy Families" is a great idea. Professional athletes 
have coaches, businessman have mentors and graduate students have advisors. 
What's available for families? Other families. I know several families who 
just have it figured out. I want to learn from them. Thank you, Mormon 
Channel. You can't be too detailed. ï»¿I think that is wonderful - what a responsibility it is to have 6 small 
children. Bless her heart..she is a great example of what a Mother should 
try to be. And she does it with a smile(probably not all the time) but 
that's okay.ï»¿I really like this video,

move around himï»¿When my kids (6) would dress themselves, they came up with clothing and 
pattern combinations that were pretty outlandish. So that people would know 
it wasn't my fault, I created badges that said, "I dressed myself!" The 
kids were so proud to wear them, and I was off the hook.ï»¿First!ï»¿Love it!ï»¿I really like the tags idea!ï»¿A really uplifting video that really gives me hope :) gets me thinking and
