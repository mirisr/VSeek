video!HELLO, THANKS A LOT FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL VIDEOS. I'm glad because I know that 
this Church is true and that we share the Gospel all over the world, no 
matter what laguage is spoken and nation we are from, we just teach what 
the Lord , Jesus Christ wants us to teach and apply to our own lives here 
on earth. I'm Alan Clase from Dominican Republic. I got some videos that 
I'd like to share here.I love this video! Thank you!Great video! Muy bien!It's so special to hear the testimonies of the missionaries, as they speak 
of the birth of Jesus Christ. The universality of the message is brought 
out just by hearing the languages they speak, and seeing the diversity 
among them. The gospel is for the whole world, the beautiful message of 
Christmas, and of the Restoration, is for all. Any of you who have not 
heard the whole story, would do well to contact your local LDS 
missionaries. You will be richly blessed.This brought tears to my eyes because of the beautiful testimonies of our 
Saviour, Jesus Christ.This is such a wonderful Testimony. This is a Solid Foundation of The 
Reason we are here and why we all have the same oppertunity to live with 
our Heavenly Father once again.The feeling and spirit that this video brings lets me forget about all the 
rushing going on around me. I'm able to slow down and really focus on why 
we have Christmas. Thank you.Beautiful message to ALL men everywhere. So well done.Wonderful testimony building video. The Church is the same around the world.Wow, I've just found my personal Christmas ecard!Wonderful - I so love hearing the voices of so many reaffirming the truth 
of the Savior's mission on this earth. That they are young and so sure is 
that much more reassuring of the truth. Thank you!It is so good to see people from all over the world sharing their 
testimonies. That is a real testimony builder, just that fact, is a 
prophecy. MargotVery inspiring! Thank you. I love the mix of languages and cultures in the 
video. It's very edifying.Very touching.Thank you so much....I really needed that today. I am so grateful for my 
belief in the Savior and your testimonies fo Him was a great lift....thank

MormonMessages Vimeo account as well. Lots of people go there for high 
quality video. Thanks for posting these!Great work. This video touched me and was perfect for what I needed in my 
life right now. Thank you.Many are asking where this video came from. This video is an official 
production of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, made 
specifically by the Audiovisual Department as a gift to all this season. 
Our channel will also serve as a place where we at Church headquarters can 
post more uplifting videos, which will be coming in January. Thanks for 
watching and Merry Christmas!Thank you!! So beautiful!Seth, thanks for adding this to your subscriptions...it fits right in with

Catholic...we all pray to the same God... there may be minor differences, 
but He is the same. Thank you, Ron for all you've taught me. BuzzVery GOOD!Beautiful video with a wonderful message of truth. Perfect for the
