prophet and its called the latter day saints because we believe we are in 
the last days of the earth The church is lead by divine inspiritation from God to Man, just like in 
the time of the apostles. He is the living prophet, Thomas S. Monson. He, 2 
councellors, and 12 apostles help lead and guide the church of Jesus 
Christ. because we're in the last days of the world and to distinguish from 
the primitive church in christs' time it's the Church of Jesus Christ of 
LATTER DAY SAINTS.Thomas S. Monson is the Lord's Prophet to the world, and the leader of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. You find more information 
about the church at mormon.org and lds.org.@bonkers9999999 Yes, Thomas Monson is the president of the Church. It's 
called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to distinguish it 
from the original Church of Jesus Christ that existed at the time of Christ 
and His Apostles as recorded in the New Testament. wow that was a great general conference, i love going to them when i have
