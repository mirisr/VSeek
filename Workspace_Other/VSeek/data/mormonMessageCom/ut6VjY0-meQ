I am not a Mormon (yet!) but I am a Christian and I just watched this video 
about the Earthly Angels of God!!!THIS IS MY INSTITUTE!!! :D my brother has that shirt as well We should go about doing good.He does a great job helping.It is amazing how you are busy all day doing his work and the spirit just 
grows stronger and stronger. It is amazing how one person can do so much 
with at first looks like so little. keep pressing forward, you still are 
going to be amazed at what he has in store for you@lizberry2 check your settings for popups and such cause it should work if 
you have downloaded the tasksBeautiful story! Serving the Lord & His children in any way is a wonderful 
thing & can be a glorious blessing! Thank you for sharing your story, Paul!Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, Polito!! Otra vez, te ves increible!! Ya te lo he dicho 
pero siempre me inspiras. Cuando estamos en el servicio del Senor aunque 
solo somos uno somos magnificados. Me recuerda una clase que tuvimos en la 
iglesia cuando hablaron del nino que ofrecio sus pocos panes y peces, DIO 
TODO LO QUE TENIA!! Pero su ofrenda sacio a miles cuando fue magnificada 
por nuestro Salvador. Que bendicion de ser parte contigo en esto. Sige 
adelante!!Thank you for this vid, I've now joined the Vineyard...I have added tasks 
to my workspace however, but when I try to start my activity and click on 
"I Agree" nothing happens - can anyone offer advice? ThanksThanks Paul. That was inspirational!
