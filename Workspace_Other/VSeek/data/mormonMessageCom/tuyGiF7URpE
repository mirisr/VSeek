I forgot what an amazing talk this was, it made me want to call up my 
father and tell him how much I loved and appreciated him. I was in tears 
within the first 20 seconds and continued that way up until the end. Oh my gosh that was so beautiful. I teared up :') I don't have a dad so 
this was kind of sad for me but also reassuring that when I get married I 
can find a man like what she described. That really is the way you raise a 
daughter, by loving her mother <3
