I need to be like he says﻿John 8:44﻿Words to live by.  Honor thy Father, Mother, brothers and sisters.﻿Beautifully said! Thank you, for your inspired fascinating and uplifting 
talk. Everything that was said, is all so true!﻿Love this talk.. l have applied the principle of forgiveness many times in 
my life, and really WORKS! ﻿So hard! Want to do as he teaches, but I have just given up on this. I love President Uchtdorf's talks. He always has such a good way of getting 
the point across.
