The clarity of this presentation should surely encourage geneology 
searchers to utilize this new tool the Church has provided.I initially clicked on this because I know Gideon but then I kept watching 
because I too am interested in my family history as is my husband. Thanks 
for teaching us about how to use such a great resource!This looks like a great way to find and access historical documents related 
to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Very cool!
