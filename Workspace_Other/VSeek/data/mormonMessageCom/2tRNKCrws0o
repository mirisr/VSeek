speaks. He lights up the room with joy and inspiration. I enjoyed the 
message and was glad to hear that Sister Monson is doing well. I send my 
prayers and blessings.hope Frances is well and of will...may the G-D bless President MonsonI'm excited to meet you Pres. Monson in the dedication of the cebu temple 
this june. I love to hear your inspirational messages for all of us. thank 
you:))I am very disapointed to see that they did not upload the yw meeting. There 
were very great talks there.180 years@canadianbacon007 I really love that response. It means a lot when we 
remember so many things relating to talks and discussions. I love this 
talk. I love when the prophets speak. I love hearing their humble words. I 
have much appreciation in the blessings we all can recieve if we strive to 
do our best and let our light so shine to those in need. The quilt making 
is such a humble experience to myself. Keep up the good work. :)I love President Monson's bubbly personality, and sense of humor. Thank you 
for this.And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who 
were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, 
or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon 
riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond 
and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, 
having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need. (Alma 1:30.)amen
