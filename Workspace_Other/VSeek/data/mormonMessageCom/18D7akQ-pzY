Some people might be inspired by this hymn to want to know more about the 
life of the Prophet. The Church has its own website (lds.org), and you can 
learn about the Prophet's visions and his family life by reading the essays 
"First Vision Accounts" and "Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo."﻿May we always continue to sing this song, forever and always, may we always 
honour the Prophet that sacrificed his very life to bring us the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ to the world, I will carry this in my heart always, I worship 
Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ but they chose the perfect man to restore 
the gospel for he lost so much in doing so.﻿Why praise to a man? All praise are to be directed to God.﻿<3:)
