I'm a child of God I know thatï»¿I sing my daughter to sleep with this song.God is the person who created the earth and everything inside it. He 
created the stars and the earth and everything. Most importantly he created 
humans. You and me he also created. He has a son Jesus who was crucified, 
so our sins can be forgiven. The main difference between god&jesus and 
humans is that god&jesus is perfect and they don't sin. Sins are doing 
things you're not suppose to do. Why don't you visit "The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter Day Saints" .awsomei loved itI am a child of God and I'm proud of it. I love you God.This Is Heaven
