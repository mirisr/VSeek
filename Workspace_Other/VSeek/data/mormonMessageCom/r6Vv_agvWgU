This is one beautiful song!﻿I could listen to this woman sing all day, phenomenal.﻿eso si es musica She has a beautiful, but terrible technique. She runs out of air all the 
time. she sings french and its written Tabernacle ... someone from quebec should 
smile... (tabarnak)Marvelous voice, it's a pitty the obvious difficulty in the breath 
control... Some silences and gasps are too pronouncedWhat language is she singing in? Is that French? Very beautiful!Oh BONTE! Je ne savais pas Mormon Tabernacle Choir chante ça! Que c'est 
beau, j'adore ça! Surtout avec Katherine Jenkins. Quelle combinaison 
parfaite! xDBravo!!!Hermoso!!! Hmmm... range issues all around. Some French needs correcting, and breath 
control questionable by evidence of vibrato pulse, and ending phrases out 
of tune and short of breath. Not ready the role yet. Lovely girl though.Basically, saying that if you don't love her, then she will love you, but 
if she loves you, beware. That's the chorus, anyway.Ha!How often is it that you get a Marilyn Monroe look alike with talent?Learn FrenchI can see her improvements in singing.Katherine voice matures as she does yet remains young and energetic. 
Powerful Mormon Choir and beautiful Spanish outfit. What a wonderful combination with her beautiful voice and that powerful 
choir behind her!Much better vocally than her earlier performence. And it is nice to see 
that she can pull off a performence without showing her cleavage.Wow! She´s great! :DEvereybody loves Katherine Jenkins.esta muy bonito el coro del tabernaculo y la hermoxa vos de Katherine 
Jenkins saluditos!!! muy hermoso!!!!!! de verdad si quieres ser feliz se mormon y lo seras por 
siempre!!!! Fantastic combination - I've never heard it sung better.Having been born in the 90's I have an acquired appreciation for this kind 
of music, and I have no idea what she's saying, but it sounds GREAT! =D I am in love with her voice! This is absolutely amazing!Just GreatThat was pretty intense!
