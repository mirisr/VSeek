I am deeply grateful for my Father in Heaven, my beloved Savior, Jesus 
Christ and the Holy Ghost. I am grateful for the fulness of the gospel upon 
the earth. I love and thank from the bottom of my heart, my Lord, God and 
King, even Jesus Christ, for the gift of His atonement. Through His 
wondrous love for me I have the opportunity to repent and stay close to the 
spirit. I try to always have, an Attitude of Gratitude. I love you Elder 
Hales and all the other wonderful leaders of Christs' church.
