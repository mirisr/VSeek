Tabernacle Choir. Very moving expression and harmony makes me want to go 
out doing good all day. Thank you Dallyn for sharing your talent.﻿MAN! Why has he not been a Christmas guest artist yet?﻿He has a lovely voice!Esto es totalmente inspirador para mi , me encanta amen de que puedo ver 
que cultivando los talentos uno puede llegar muy lejos como ha sucedido en 
este caso con Dallyn Vail Bayles y el hermoso coro que le acompaña, es 
maravillosoI loved working with him too on Savior of the World, the first time it was 
staged in 2000. He's incredible.A beautiful rendition of this so rarely heard song! Thanks MC for posting.
