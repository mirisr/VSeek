<3﻿Wonderful🙏🏼﻿This is the most beautiful arrangement I have ever heard of this hymn.  I 
grew up playing this for our church.  I have been an organist since the age 
of 8 and choral conductor after my college years and find that the simplest 
of hymns arranged in this fashion can be the most powerful.  I was so moved 
by the young man at 4:39 singing and tears streaming down his face.  I have 
experienced this while performing as a choir member in university as well 
as playing hymn services through my life.  It is wonderful to be able to 
perform and and still have the heart touched at the same time.   Thank you 
for this absolutely moving piece of music and the reverence with how it was 
done!﻿Thank you so much for making this.  I have never felt the Spirit stronger! 
 I found myself in a situation that I could not get out of unless I 
listened to hymns.  This was the song I heard first.  Until now, I have 
never sobbed from how strongly I felt the peace, comfort, and companionship 
of the Holy Spirit.  This song spoke to my soul.  Thank you.﻿A combined choir from Brigham Young University sings "Did You Think to 
Pray?"﻿It is arranged by Lane Johnson, and details of how to obtain the 
arrangement are on his website. If you search youtube again for "did you 
think to pray lane johnson" you should see the website addressI love the guy at 4:39 with tears streaming down his face - about 20 years 
ago I was on a tour of America (from the UK), and we ended up at Salt Lake 
City for the night. The tour guide said if anyone was interested, the 
Mormon Tabernacle Choir was rehearsing that evening and anyone could go. I 
remember sitting with tears running down my face as the sound of 300-odd 
voices singing beautiful music washed over me.Will anyone connected to or involved in singing, playing or directly this 
very lovely setting of the familiar hymn please provide the folllowing 
details? - name of arranger and the publishing company? Thank you so much.Awesome!!!!
