very nice SUCCESS!!I grew up in a family of 10, 6 boys 4 girls all born over a 15 year span. I 
hoped to have 6 to 8 children in my own family but we only got two - great 
children. I like large families and they types of children that come from 
them frequently have learned some life lessons not easily available in 
smaller families.
