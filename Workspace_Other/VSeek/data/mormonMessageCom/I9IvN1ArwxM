wonderful.....one of the most beautiful, peaceful, reverent melody that 
once near every child learned in early school in a more peaceful, innocent 
time but now we took God, prayer, and songs like this out of the public 
school curriculum and now look at what kind of schools, society, and 
younger generations we have today.........  hola, esta canci√≥n me hace sentir muy humilde, gracias por subirla./hi, 
this song makes me feel very humble, thanks for upload.Rocket Man.... too funny... :)beautiful!Pretty comical...but beautiful nonetheless!I like to be able to sing that good, but when I do vocals I end up coughing 
up blood...Whenever I hear this song I can't help but think of the movie RocketMan. :)Gorgeous! I loved the handbells <3
