 I listened to this talk for my gospel study and I loved it! It is a great 
message. If you haven't listened to it, listen to it. You will not regret 
it. 😍﻿I'm not sure if you're watching the same General Conferences as I do, but 
women are acknowledged in every conference. In fact they have a Women's 
Session, just as they do a Priesthood Session, every conference. This is a 
great talk by Elder Ballard.
