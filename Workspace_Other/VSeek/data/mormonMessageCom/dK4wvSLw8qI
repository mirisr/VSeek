http://www.squidoo.com/summer-gifts-to-make-her-smileï»¿I beg to differ my friend. I think that way many people act in and think 
about marriage is really saddening. While not all marriages work out, any 
two people who love the Lord can have that precious, loving, marital 
relationship that surpasses all others of this world.Thanks for sharing this :D I'm happy to hear of successes like this :DGreat testimony!!! Blessings...Eternal marriage is just one of many goals that heavenly father has set for 
us. Marriage is taken very seriously in our religion. Or should I say the 
restored gospel of the savior Jesus Christ. You should investigate our 
church, the promise of great knowledge is there. The knowledge you obtain 
will also give you the strength to endure persecutions of all kinds in this 
world. Just remember when you step onto the right path, Satan will work 
harder on you to derail you.so true.. Get together with mum and dad and kneel down and say a prayer instead. The 
more people involved in prayer, the more Heavenly Father will hear :-)Marriage is a joke.im so sorry, stay strong good spirit. there is more to this thing than we 
know. but know its not always as it seems ... and it will make sense 
someday. you can become a mormon = ) just do it,You definitely have the right attitude about it! I can give you no advice 
(as I've never been married; I'm only fifteen years old), but I can 
encourage you and pray for you.I think the very best thing you can do in this situation is show your 
parents how much you love them and that you are willing to work with them 
and understand them no matter what happens.What a powerful message, enhanced by the powerful videography. Thanks to 
the many willing talents and hours of work that made this possible. I like this video. I wish I had seen it way before. My marriage will be a 
few months short of 15 years by the time our divorse is finalized. I'm so 
worry about our kids. They are failing school and are acting out. The 
youngest would not remember a time when there's a father and a mother in 
the same house. I pray that my wife would snap out of whatever she's 
involve in and come home.it is just great how a life can be spared by our father above helping us in 
our trail ahead.Good luck on your journeyI'm not a mormon but I am loving this channelyou are right. Bom demais...Love and needed this.Sometimes divorce is necessary for us to move forward as a people! It's not 
a bad thing. Divorce is for unhappy people. PeriodI understand what you are going thru, My parents got divorced over 1 year 
ago, Im 24 and its still very hard for me, I blame myself a lot even do I 
dont have fault in it. Please tell your parents that a bad marriage is 
better that a good divorced, I know this to be true. Advice for you is not 
to do like me, its a very hard path. Read this talk it really helped me: 
lds.org/new-era/2000/08/when-parents-divorce?lang=eng go to lds.org and 
search "Divorced parents" Ill pray 4 ur familyI'm going through a rough patch right now.. I just found out my parents are 
seeing a marriage counselor and i'm not sure what's going to happen. I've 
prayed about it, but I haven't really received an answer. I'm 20 so I 
understand that sometimes it is for the best.. But I am so scared that this 
will end in divorce.. I never believed in divorce but for adultery, yet there came a time when I 
thought it was completely justified. So, I sought the Lord in prayer-& 
begged to be released from my bondage but every time I searched the New 
Testament for guidance I'd open pages about God hating divorce, 
forgiveness, loving your spouse, praying for them, etc. After many days of 
prayer & fasting I began to see my own errors instead, & begged his 
forgiveness-We both changed our hearts, worked hard, & happily together.I never believed in divorce, yet there came a time when I thought it was 
completely justified. So, knowing divorce to be wrong, I went to the Lord 
in prayer-begging & pleading with God to release me from my bondage. I 
fasted & prayed but every time I searched the New Testament for guidance, I 
opened pages about how God hates divorce, forgiveness, loving your spouse & 
praying for them...After many days I began to see my own errors & begged 
his forgiveness-We both changed & are happier than ever.Sending prayers your way. I know it has been a while since you posted this. 
My wife and I had problems early on but we worked through them and have a 
great marriage now. I hope everything worked out for you.my parents filed for divorce after almost 40 years of marriage, escrow for 
my childhood home just closed today. My mom is giving me the wedding rings 
that used to belong to them today as well. My husband of 15 years will go 
with me and watch as I say goodbye to what I thought was true and real. 
This video is a blessing, I am humbled by it.The Atonement is infinate and can heal any wound. Nobody is too far gone 
for the Atonement to reach them and heal them. Of course, in a marriage 
situation, both must desire healing and have faith that the marriage can be 
mended. If one or both refuse to make adjustments very little progress can 
be made. It only takes faith and humility and Christ will heal anything. 
Also must want it more than anything in the world-because it's hard work. 
All the best to your friends.Priceless council. This advice saved my marriage and brought us a joy and 
peace beyond what we thought was possible. Our problems lay hidden beneath 
the surface-little hurts from small neglects-never acknowledged or delt 
with, one day came to a head. @ 20 yrs, It was over. Because of our promise 
in the Temple we pushed thru and had strength to begin to treat our 
marriage as living thing-needing daily nurturing and care. Atonement healed 
our marriage. 27 years now! A True Miracle. It's worth it. You keep fighting for it. Don't fight him for it, but fight with him 
against divorce. It's the most important fight and God will be with you as 
you work through it and with it towards even happier days. The Gospel is light. It feels good to be in the light. It sucks being in 
darkness. Stand in the light. Gissel...don't give up....but go and talk to your bishop....he can give you 
great advice. May God heal your marriage as he has mine. No I know the guy with the blue shirt @ 0:42, He went to the same High school 
that I do, and he is my brothers friend:) Beautiful message by the way! I'm 
not married yet, but I look forward to the day when I can get married to my 
best friend in the Temple!I want to find my eternal companion... I'm LDS married for 5 years and sealed for time and all eternity one week 
after my legal marriage. I'm trying to make my marriage work I have three 
beautiful daughters....my husband told me to move on he's says we're 
incompatible but he's selfish and prideful. We don't really communicate he 
stopped going to church. I'm not sure what the end is going to be; I'm 
praying the Lord's will be done and I'll have the strength to accept the 
outcome and feel at peace....if these people are Mormons they should talk with their bishop , but if i 
was him i would leave it doesn't seem like she really loves him if she is 
going to keep cheating on him, some people divorce over silly things that 
are not that major thats what i think the message is trying to sayyou are in my prayers I know a marriage, she cheated 1 year ago, he stayed and forgave. 1 year 
anniversary, she cheated again with a different person several times. 
Should the faithful husband who madly loves her stay?I am currently going through a divorce, pray for me and my wife. She is 6.5 
months pregnant& moved 2900 miles away. She thinks god is leading her to 
divorce me. Our issues are small compared to most.We need some free time 
together and prayer, our possibilities are unlimited. Please pray for us 
and that the atonement will be a major part of our life. I love her more 
than anything and miss her like crazy.I'll never take her for Granted again 
if she comes back comitted to us. Gods will be done...I've been watching a few of these videos, and its important to remember 
most of them are more philosophical pieces, than specifically Mormon pieces.Great message. I agree totally ... except in cases of mass abuse, addiction 
or adultery. I am personally in the middle of divorce and would love to 
stop it. I am Lds and my wife is as well. We had ups and Downs but nothing 
to divorce over. I continue to pray for her daily and our marriage too. She 
is 6.5 months pregnant and 3000 miles away. I really miss her and pray she 
has a change of heart. Please remember me when you guys pray. Through the 
atonement of Jesus christ anything is possibleexcellent thankswow, Cring right now, I now Im going to live chastely and live the 
standards. I know I will find my eternal compainion and I will never forget 
marriage is such a amazing gift.Mudsqid, the church did not keep you in an abusive marriage for 25 years. 
You kept yourself there. You really should read Elder Oaks' entire message 
on divorce. I am sorry you suffered, but the Church does not want any woman 
to be in an abusive marriage. My sister was deceived by her husband and 
emotionally abused. Our whole LDS family support her 100 percent in seeking 
a divorce. It was the right thing to do. In the eyes of the church it was 
the right thing to do.I will not say that you "need" Jesus, but, let me ask you, if I may--what 
is the source of your happiness? Is it not the love that you have and share 
with your wife and your kids? If love is a source of happiness then is it 
not good to seek greater love? May I suggest that perhaps Jesus could serve 
as a role model for learning how to love unconditionally. His was a perfect 
example of unconditional love. As I follow His example, I learn to love 
more and thus to have more joy and happiness.Being married for 16 years, this video inspires me to keep pressing 
forward! Is any marriage really even exist without some type of occasion 
disagreements. Life and love are so fragile but constantly need nourishment 
from one another. I love the scene of the older couple..,made me shed a 
tear! Prayer, scriptures, and regular temple visits.UTMusicMom, I am not married, but from the words of God's living prophets 
I've learned the answer. In all my relationships I've ever had, if I didn't 
love the other person, I found ways to grow that love. Serving him/her. 
Talking openly. Finding things to do together. I found that as I did these 
things, the love that was initially lacking eventually grew strong on both 
sides. Just as Elder Oaks says in this video, love is a living thing and it 
can grow or die depending on your choices.IÂ´ve learned that the best way to learn how to love someone, no matter 
whom, is to serve him/her. The world preaches that weÂ´ll love those who 
first loves us. But, to be honest, itÂ´s the opposite. First serve your 
spouse and then youÂ´ll learn how to love him/her. Believe me. perfeito!! como Ã© maravilhoso conhecer o evangelho verdadeiro de Cristo.Serve him. No. You *need* to be happy. What that means is entirely up to you.You decide whether you would be happier together or apart.You learn to love those you serve. If you find you do not love your spouse, 
then perhaps it would be wise to look for more opportunities to serve him 
or her.And if he beats you? can you contemplate divorce? Do not every say that! You are Heavenly Father's little girl!! You are 
precious to Him and He loves you more than you can understand. You put Him 
first He will tell you what's second. You can do this. The Lord can provide 
a way to make your marriage work. I just know it. And if it doesn't I'm 
sure He has another plan for you. Do not give up Hope! You can do this! And 
you are worth it! do not believe the lies of the adversary of give him any 
sort of power. You are loved remember that. serve himHe talks about the divorce that is created because of simple things. Most 
of the time divorce is not a way out. But when in an abusive relationship, 
it's safety. I am LDS, and so is my mother. My mother is divorced. She 
prayed about it for a long time. There are a lot of times where it is the 
right choice. Pray about it. Ponder it. Read the scriptures. Don't make a 
hasty decision.What do you do when you get along but don't love him? If you read the original message, he talks about just that. I find that 
very few of general authority messages are meant to be universally 
comprehensive; if they were, they'd never get to any specific point. 
Researching the topic through other talks by general authorities and the 
scriptures will always help one to understand the topic thoroughly. I'm 
sorry you had to suffer, no one should from abuse or divorce. But please 
don't blame the G.A.'s for not being comprehensive enough in one talk.I am working to save my marriage at the moment. my husband has wanted to 
end it he asked for a divorce just before easter. which was 2 weeks before 
out first wedding anniversary :'( we have had rough patches with his 
depression and what not but through everything i have stood by him, i love 
him and i know we are meant to be together but he just doesn't seem to know 
it. i don't want to have to live without him but he doesn't seem to want to 
me the way i am :( I'm not good enough anymorePerfectly said!Thanks, Elder Oaks. :)I spent a year performing a statistical meta-analysis of marriage-related 
studies, looking for patterns in marriage/divorce trends. One thing I found 
repeatedly during that time was that people in cultures where marriages are 
arranged viewed it as more of a "choice" than a love-based marriage, 
because they were able to find a spouse based on a list of compatibilities 
rather than a quick whirlwind of romance. These people recognize that 
marriage is about creating love from experiences.Great video, wonderful message. Thanks for sharing! :)Divorce is permissible in those situations. Even God approves when the 
marriage is an abusive one. No one should have to suffer. Just trust in God 
and he will help you make the right decisions. Esta buenisimo.... ojala lo pasen a espaÃ±ol para poder compartirlo!!! :) When a marriage is dead and beyond hope of resuscitation, it is needful to 
have a means to end it..... a quote straight from Elder Oaks mouth.At the end of the video there is a link to Elder Oaks message on 
Divorce...I think you need to see the entire picture he paints. Of course 
we all understand there are times when dissolving a marriage is 
appropriate. I'm not sure why you felt that the notion to divorce is always 
impermissble, I've never heard that message from any general authority.Interesting question. To me the answer is a clear "YES!" Because Jesus is 
the son of God and lived a perfect life, He was able to pay for every wrong 
that has ever been done to you, and every wrong you have done to another. 
That knowledge has helped me more easily forgive others, and has given me 
peace regardless of disasters or even small inconveniences. The happiness 
you feel now doesn't have to end at death--doesn't your love for your 
family feel bigger than this life? It's because it is!Where there is no marriage, the people perish. Redefining marriage isn't a 
work around either.3 dislikes??? Really? What is to dislike? The truth is the truth! This is a 
message that can hurt you the core if you are not working on YOUR marraige! 
Is that why this message got those 3 dislikes?I loved the shot of the couple going from young and robust to old and 
aged--but TOGETHER. That was what got me. Beautifully done. Cried so hard.. wow...I agree with the basic concept of this video, but like any 
general-authority message, it lacks nuance and fails to recognize that 
there are cases where it is far better to dissolve a marriage than to keep 
it together. The LDS notion that divorce is always impermissible kept me in 
a marriage where I was being abused for 25 years. It greatly harmed me and 
my children. Had I been able to give myself permission to divorce, I would 
have done so much earlier and saved myself and my kids.Thank you for the wonderful message*sniffle* so true...so true...what a great message. Marriage is the most precious gift I have ever had. 
It's so important to be kind to each other and always put your spouse 
before yourself - and make sure they do the same. I've been married for 10 
years and with effort we have been able to maintain that excited, 
butterflies-newlywed feeling everyday when we wake up together. We have 
changed a lot in those 10 years but we evolved together, making us even 
closer. If you have found your life's love, never give up!!!
