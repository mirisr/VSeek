this apostle seems different, he is young, and I can understand what he 
says, he is weak and yet so strong!﻿I love the LDS Church so much!﻿As the darkness of night turns into day
Gradually till the fullness of the sun appears.
So too revelation comes our way
To be discerned as the obstruction of doubt (time, sin, pride) clears.﻿I love to listen to Elder Bednar's talks. He speaks clearly with conviction 
and authority.﻿Great talk - thank you Elder Bednar. Another great talk on the Spirit of 
Revelation given by Elder Holland at BYU - "Cast not away therefore your 
confidence" 2 march 1999 - Wonderful talks!I want a "love" button for this talk. Amazing! what a brilliant talk!
