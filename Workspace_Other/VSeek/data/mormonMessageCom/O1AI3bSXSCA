Sweet!!! An official LDS video that shows Jesus Christ visiting the 
Nephites/Lamanites, depicting them as the Hopewell Moundbuiler culture who 
lived in the ancient lands that are now the United States! The Hopewell 
Moundbuilder's timeline fits almost directly with the Nephite timeline. And 
the Adena Moundbuilder's timeline fits almost directly with the Jaredite 
timeline. And the more research I do about these two Moundbuilder cultures, 
the more parallels I find between them and the people of The Book of 
Mormon. I love it!﻿Every time we read
We must ponder the thought
What message do we need
In our heart to be taught?﻿
