I have heard a lot of japanese accents in my lifetime... from 0:33- 0:51 
this lady doesn't sound japanese. Were they born somewhere else with 
Japanese family members? This is a powerful devistation, this Tsunami.... 
it makes me appreciate all god has given me and want to reach out and help 
others who are under the influences of calamity.I couldn't believe it either. Yes, we have to do something.Love is the only way to react.Be faithful and strong, facing the earthly experiences with the Spirit beautiful
