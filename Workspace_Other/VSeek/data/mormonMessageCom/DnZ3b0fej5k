This is So True! I Can Personally Testify that What He is Saying is 
Applicable to All People. The Church Has Given Me Peace and Strength that I 
Never Fully Noticed until after I Had Neglected the Truth (Starting in 
Small Harmful and Irresponsible Decisions), and Eventually Lost My Daily 
Strength and Blessings. I Will Never Do That Again. I Hope All People Can 
Learn From this Lesson taught and Apply it's Knowledge to their own Lives.Reminded me of a saying "look after the pennies and the pounds will look 
after themselves." The accumulation of all those small decisions mount up 
to either our good or detriment. The decision to smoke, or not, that first 
cigarette can have a major impact on health and finances. The decision to 
attend all of your Sunday meetings can provide increased faith, testimony 
and be a strength against temptations power. Wise words indeed and wiser 
still to heed them. He was my mission President in the NetherlandsInteresting how small and simple things lead both towards AND away from the 
comfort and peace living true to God's truth.Awesome talk
