Im trying to be like Jesus Why do the Bible verses quoted in the Book of Mormon contain the italicized 
words from the King James Version that were added into the KJV text by the 
translators in the 16th and 17th centuries? So what happened to our World and why does evil exist? Why are there Rich 
and Poor? How come most people aren't treated equally? Why did the world 
turn into the world it is now? If capitalism and colonialism never happened 
then would it still be peaceful and full of love?It's funny how soon pride catches a hold of them though. I love the book of 
mormon because it teaches us so much about ourselves, how if we aren't 
careful, we will forget to thank God and soon our peace will lead to pride 
and then misery.I marvel at the peace these Saints of God had in the land. Blessed be the 
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
