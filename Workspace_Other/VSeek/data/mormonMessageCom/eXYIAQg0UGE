fulfilling Relief Society humanitarian projects I've ever participated in. 
I study birth and aspire to work with new or pregnant mothers. It was 
heartwarming to know that the razor, string, gloves, sterile pads, and 
other items we packed would make a difference on the day a mother meets her 
baby for the first time. ﻿
