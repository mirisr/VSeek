I love this program!  my addiction has led me back to my Heavenly Father, 
humbled me and allowed Him to bless me and strengthen me to be able to 
carry this burden and abstain from the desires of my addiction.﻿I'm grateful for this gospel. And I'm grateful that God allows us to 
repent. And once again offer his blessing to us again. With out repentance 
I would not be allowed to return back to my Heavenly Father. Thank goodness 
for the principle of Repentance:)﻿Thank You, Mormon Channel for your help with so many. gamblers, Sugar 
addicts, drinkers, pill users, fatty meat addicts, cocaine users, speed, 
heroin, cigarrette, television, online computer and handheld 
device addicts, etc...as well as Gossip addicts.﻿I attended my first meeting yesterday in Sacramento, CA. I think you will 
be surprised at some of my past experiences and knowledge of other 12 step 
societies and people of my past. I pity the poor person who has to hear my 
5th Step. that will take quite some time if i am to be thorough.... David 
Baumgartner. Oh. I was glad to hear everyone is addicted to something or 
other.﻿I needed this. Alot.
