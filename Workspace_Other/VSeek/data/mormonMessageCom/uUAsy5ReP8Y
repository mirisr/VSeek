i love this song and all who sang in it have such beautiful voices﻿when I sang this song at church I cried real bad and still continue on﻿Elder Bromley (guy in black leather jacket and white t shirt) is serving 
here in the mission I live in!!!﻿I love this song! Sister Missionaries sang this at my baptism just a few 
months ago! It was perfect. ﻿Tbh I cry everytime I listen to this song lol﻿:)﻿
