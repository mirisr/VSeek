Yes indeed! I have been struggling with an addiction to video games (ones 
that weren't of a good standard) in my youth. Today, however, I set some 
goals to restrain from the worldliness that resonate bad things. I couldn't 
have done this of course without repentance, faith, and virtue. I had 
nobody to lean on, so I came to the Lord with a "broken heart and a 
contrite spirit..." and he took me in ;DI am a member of LDS since I was 10 years old. This is one of my favorites 
hymn, " Ye elders of Israel" my heart is filled with joy and looking 
forward to be in the celestial glory. I have a strong testimony , but at 
this time I feel discourage of going to church anymore , for I have seen 
some local leaders in our church and some members are hypocrites. Lord 
please help me overcome this problem.Good worki love this song i want to be a mormon one day
