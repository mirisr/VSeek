One of all time favorite! !!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😊😊😊﻿This is so good, someone can tell me the name of the piano song please?﻿President Henry B. Eyring is known by some to have said: If we are not 
being rebuked by the Spirit, then we need to change the way we are praying.﻿It will just trust him.﻿This has always been one of my favorites.﻿I'm not a mormon but I love this story....﻿Wonderful video!
﻿I`M 7O YEARS OLD. MANY TIMES THE LORD HAS LEAD ME IN DIRECTIONS THAT I 
THOUGHT WERE WRONG, ONLY TO FIND VERY SPECIAL BLESSINGS THERE. TODAY WE ARE 
CARINR FOR A LITTLE GIRL THAT LIVES WITH US. WE NEED SPECIAL PRAYER BECAUSE 
WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP HER WITH US, RATHER THAN GOING TO A BAD LIVING PLACE. 
PLEASE PRAY THAT SHE WILL HAVE PEACE. I AM NOT MORMON, BUT KNOW OF THE 
POWER OF PRAYER!﻿This provides so much reassurance to me upon my send home early from the 
mission.﻿What an amazing video and story!!! Thank you for sharing this. ﻿I love this talk. I always look around and see bad things happening even to 
me because of pathetic reasons like what religion am I affiliated with him. 
I have felt his pain. He isn't alone. None of you are. There is always 
comfort for you. Keep faith in God. You will be blessed.﻿Thank you, so so much...I cannot tell you what these words mean to 
me...Thank you, thank you lord, for loving me enough to cut me down, for 
loving enough to let me fail to measure up, so that I can be taught the 
lesson that can only be learned from the atonement.﻿Bueno..good..﻿There are so many times when I asked "Why me?” Even though I am only 18, I 
have gone through so much. Some people ask me how did you go through all 
that? Just faith in God that Everything will be okay, and the strength he 
gives me to keep going. So many times I have felt to give up, when 
everything around me have to crumble into pieces. I got addicted to self 
harm, cutting. But I know that I am grateful for the trials that have come 
into my life. That doesn't mean I want them to happen again. But that I 
have learned so much from all the mistakes I have made, the mistake of 
others. And losing people so close, knowing I'll see them again. He gives 
me the strength I need. I just need to do my part, and I know I'll overcome 
anything, even my addiction to cutting. And I leave this with you all..﻿I saw this video in Sunday school I truly felt his pain ﻿Drugs have ruined my life. I have chronic depression, crippling social 
anxiety, and my family looks down upon me as if i am the most disgraceful 
human to ever walk the planet. I hope this message rings true for me 
because I have definitely been cut down. God bless everyone I hope some day 
this storm will pass. ﻿Friends, this is one of my favorite videos. I can see this happening in my 
own life as I have been led on a different course than what I anticipated. 
I'm not sure why I find so much comfort in this video but I do. Such a 
great lesson. ﻿Thanks Dear God for loving me enough to even cutting me down so often
Thy Will be done !!!﻿I love it! Such an awesome message!!!!I have looked into what you do on youtube and the comments you make on 
videos similar to this one, and I am so sorry for you. I am not trying to 
belittle you, but you must have it hard, being that angry. The people who 
come to this video are looking for inspiration when their lives become very 
difficult and they need that open hand to help them. I hope you find what 
it is you are looking for to be happy <:). Maybe if you listen to what you 
feel, and not what you hear, things will be better.This is Sister Kaelie Teeters favorite in the MTC! Not if it's God who does the pruning. This video does not promote child 
abuse in any way. Never once does it mention or advocate hurting children. 
The point of the story is that we all go through trials and struggles, some 
of which can be painful. We can wallow in our hurt and anger, or we can 
have faith and learn from our experiences, and trust God. Thank you Mr. Gardener.. truly inspiringfavorite Mormon message If we have such a great plan for our lives and Heavenly Father says no to 
it and takes us down a different path, then it must be a better plan than 
even the one we had for ourselves.We all go through trials in order to gain vital characteristics that are of 
Eternal weight in gold. When we cry about the horrible things that happen 
we should remember that God knows the glory that should follow after this 
life if we remain faithful. Much like when we see a child cry about having 
to wait for something, we the adult have a larger perspective. This is 
similar to what God sees. Not to mention the hurt spoken of in this video 
is specifically for what Elder Brown became.There is One who loves us and looks out for our eternal welfare. wow you clearly do no know a single member. Mormons believe children aren't 
responsible for their actions and are the most loving gentle parents in the 
world! They take the call of parent hood at the utmost respect and most 
precious gift Heavenly Father can give.I love this video. I have a pretty good channel and the only videos i keep 
up from recently watched are from Mormon Messages.It isn't cutting down and hurting. It's pruning and correcting. There's a 
drastic difference. Mormons are the last people to promote child abuse. 
What is being said here is that loving parents must sometimes do things 
that children think are mean, but in reality are just the opposite. It may 
take time and perspective, but hopefully the child will recognize those 
loving acts for what they really are.Do you know where I can get the background music fot this video?who can dislike this? AmenHi ! ;pI love this message :)You should meet one :)Not only in the USA my friend, In South America it is almost unbelievable 
how fast it grows. In this very moment the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter 
Day Saints has 69,000 missionaries serving. I'm living in Germany this year 
and I baptized 3 months ago :)I, too, need to remember that God is the gardener here. I know he is always 
right. leave it to the great speakers, seers and revelators of this church to make 
me cry from feeling the spirit.I love the church of Jesus Christ Of latter day Saints.As a young man, serving a mission for the LDS Church I listened to this 
audio tape (YES TAPE) by Hugh B Brown What a humbling story! I am very 
grateful for this story! Love Inspired Correction! nice message and nice animationthanks for sharing!!! im so much related in this video clip. beckygerren06 Did you watch the video? "Cut me down" was used in the 
story...it's used to show that sometimes we aren't given exactly what we 
want, but God has something better for us if we are obedient to Him. But 
it's what we aren't given that feels like we're being cut down. Hopefully 
that helps...niceTough love. It's the kind of love that helps us & others make a choice 
instead of going down a dark & dreary pathway to not reach our potential. 
God loves us so much! He invests so much into us because He can see our 
potential and worth, He's our eternal father & loves us unconditionally. 
Our immortality & eternal life are his work and glory and He loves his 
work. He wants what's best for us, He knows what's best for us. He loves 
us, the love he has is more powerful than anything of this Earth.I think, at times, the greatest challenge we face, as eathly beings, is to 
be thankful when we are in very eye of the hurricanes that enter into our 
lives. This, more than ever, is when we need to remember to have faith. 
This, and no other time, will be be given the opportunity to excersise our 
faith...and through the excersising of that faith...we can only 
then...become strong.Thanks!i love mormonsAmenThis is a very difficult concept to grasp, accepting the will of the Lord. 
Mind you, not reluctantly. In recent prayers, I have been asking the Lord 
to help me learn to accept His will. It was always difficult, but it has 
given me comfort - something I am now realizing as I type this up. I thank 
the Lord for this Church and for the Truth restored, and for a pair of 
missionaries meeting my mother decades ago. Golly, this is lovelyexactly what I needed today. I needed this message today. Thanks for loving me enough, Heavenly Father, 
to cut me down so many years ago so you could shape me into the person I am 
today. I hope I continue to be the person Heavenly Father wants me to be 
every day.By the spirit. Study, take the discussions, read the Book of Mormon and 
pray. If any man will ado his bwill, he shall cknow of the doctrine, 
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.' John 7:17 and again 
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."Matt 7:20. I have put it to 
the test. I am grateful for his love in restoring his gospel and his 
priesthood to the earth, that we might be able to know him, and have the 
necessary ordinances for salvation.Today I had to withdraw from a class that I found very important for my 
goals and future education. It was a desicion that I did not want to do, 
but I did it, and now watching this, I know that God has a more fulfilling 
plan than going to school. I just hope I will be to do it.this is amazingGod definitely has a plan for all of us. There are always lessons in our 
trials in order to shape us into what we were meant to be. I am so thankful 
for the lessons, trials, and tender mercies that Heavenly Father has given 
to me......He loves us all so much, and it is all a part of the eternal 
plan. This is such a beautiful message.Didn't Moses speak to a talking bush? That was HOW he got promoted.You need to study the word of God and learn about what the Church is. You 
can talk to Mormon missionaries to learn about it. They will direct you in 
how to learn about our Church, about the Holy Ghost and how to recognize 
answers from God. Hope this helps! I know that this, the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter Day Saints, is God's true Church on earth as she said, but 
it is important that everyone learns this for themselves. "I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do, 
because I notice it always coincides with their own desires." -Susan B. 
Anthony-I believe i understand the parallel, the message via the comparison and 
imagined similitude. Able to relate the image of the guileless child 
nature, tho from a vastly dis-similar experience, yet wanting to understand 
; God, faith, religion, spirit, and scripture. To this end i live, at 5 i 
asked of death, life and earth, now above 50 - my understanding is; 
Religion is to spirit, as brick to ocean - scripture to Father what a 
scrabble is to Nature. The wide-Road is to narrow g8, as war to living.I loved it! Wonderfully said!The true church is the body of Christ! (We are the body of Christ 
(Believers) Question everything and only accept those whom you question to 
be of the holy spirit we cannot do works to receive grace believe not in a 
denomination but instead believe in Christ! For as soon as we accept Christ 
our spirit is baptized into him, A ceremony cannot make you any more one 
with God than he has already made you by the blood of his precious and holy 
son.becuase of the natural man that we all are, sometimes we can not see nor 
accept the will of our father in heaven, i too have being recently cut down 
to the floor., but i know in my heart with out a thouhgt, that it is his 
will and that he has greater things in my future for what i am being 
prepare to. i love the fact that he loves me enough to guide me & prepare 
me for what he knows its best for me and my kids. i forever greatfull to my 
savior & my father in heaven for all they have done for me.Simply by her desire to know Daily prayer, Service, Repentance, Reading the 
book of mormon Read the Book of Mormon and read a little bit more everyday 
and ask god in sincere prayer is this book true and the rest will come to 
you @MrSoloTron Through prayer, an open mind, a broken heart, and a contrite 
spirit. That's how I knew. Trials help us grow and become better people! Read sir, Read the Bible and Book of Mormon side by side. Have an open mind 
and forget all your indoctrinated hate that the world teaches. Get down on 
your knees and pray to Heavenly Father. End the prayer in the sons name. 
What does your heart tell you after you ask the lord on high what he 
thinks. If it is still no then by all means continue on sir. I will still 
love you and not judge you. Truth is simply a matter of faith, god is not real "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." James 1:5 If you 
want to know which is the true church of the Lord, then you should ask the 
Lord directly in prayer, and if you ask with a sincere heart with a real 
intention to know then the Lord will answer to you, through thoughts or 
feelings such as "...love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, 
faith, meakness, temperance..." Galatians 5:22-23We can know because we can pray and ask God. He didn't go on to say why he didn't get his promotion. Wasn't that shortly 
before his call to be a general authority? If he had gotten the promotion, 
he would not have been able to accept the calling.Prayer. Look at Moroni 10:3-5
