Thank youï»¿@svenssonsk Elder is a title referring to the office in the priesthood. The 
Elders that you're referring to are probably the young missionaries, and 
they are generally referred to with that title, in reference to their 
priesthood, essential to their ministry. Others with callings to serve, 
particularly the Apostles and Seventies, are similarly referred to as 
Elders in reference to their ministry.thank you :)Thank you for this video!Wow, an elder that is older than 18. Recordemos quienes somos. y por que estamos aqui.
