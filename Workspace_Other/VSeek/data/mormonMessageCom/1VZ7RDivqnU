Heart warming, what strength this brother n sister haveBless you both for being vulnerable in such a candid interview. I commend 
you for being able to share this experience for all the world. I do not 
know this loss, but identify with the feelings of 'why did this have to 
happen to my child?' This may sound trite but I think the only way Heavenly 
Father was going to soften my bitter heart was through one of my children. 
I would die for them. having to yield control of their lives to Heavenly 
Father was difficult. I could not take the pain from them.thank you, thank, you, thank you Elder and Sister Bowen. I really needed to 
hear this today. Turn to the lord and remember what is important; the 
covenants we make in this life. We all have lost dear ones to the face of death thanks for your words we re 
on the same boat!Thank you, Elder and Sister Bowen, for sharing your heartfelt testimonies 
of your coping with the loss of your son. I am not LDS, I am an Orthodox 
Christian, but everything you mention about your son Tyson, how he has been 
exalted as an angel and lives in God's presence, my faith also teaches. I 
lost my twin brother after just 17 days of life. I know he is with God, and 
this is an indescribable blessing. May the Lord always bless you and your 
family and may His Spirit always gladden your hearts!
