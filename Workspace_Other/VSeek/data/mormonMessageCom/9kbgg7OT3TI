I agree, it's important to be kind and good, whether you believe in God or 
not. Thanks for your post. :)I hope whatever you follow brings you happiness. I do know that you can 
find greater happiness by going to the source of truth, that is God 
himself. Like drinking water straight from the spring as opposed to when 
it's been processed, you can know God by going to Him rather than reading 
what the world says about Him.God lives, Christ lives, The Gospel is true! :)PEACE ...you people know there is no god right? and you can follow simply being a 
good person and what have you and not be brainwashed... just letting you 
guys know. please!! we need them at Spanish!! love these videosMuito bonito. Sugiro que seja colocado legenda ou que seja dublado em 
outros idiomas. Mensagem muito linda.This is so encouraging. That's what I love about the Gospel. I feel 
constantly encouraged.Thank you for making this captioned! :) What a Beautiful Reminder of the Greatest Gift we Recieve from our Loving 
Savior.. I love our Lord!Amazing!!Great Job!
