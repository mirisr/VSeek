You are the essence of Pure Love. You've gone through the refiners fire to 
be the perfect instrument to help those that are going through similar 
struggles, past, present and future. Love (God) needed one of the most 
powerful images of him to reflex his image which is Love. As I sit here 
crying at my desk it brings me tears and feelings of PURE LOVE. I love you 
Holly! Carry on. I'm here with you to spread the message of LOVE. :)ï»¿I am SO hapy te church did these REAL stories! Watching these my heart hurt
