We can help do volunteer work, sponsor a family, or contribute to 
LDScharities.org depending on our situation and abilities.﻿this is an awesome video﻿It is heart-warming to see strangers help their brothers and sisters in 
need.﻿This is so inspiring and what that one women did is so amazing. We 
definitely shouldn't underestimate the power of one person. We all should 
embark in service for others because at the end of the day we are all 
humans ....we all look the same on the inside. We all have feelings and 
emotions. None of those people deserved this. It's depressing. But one 
person can make such a huge difference in the life of many. Today I helped 
one of my friends with science as she showed me a quiz that she got back. I 
thought that I wasn't going to have no affect on her but just wanted to 
help. But after I was finish explaining everything she was happy and said 
that I explained it way better then her teacher did. She said she never 
understood it before so it just brought a smile to my face.... and I just 
tried to encourage her to keep on trying. She wanted to give up and drop 
the course but as I was helping her I realized that no one should give 
up...there is help ahead. I also realized that I shouldn't give up on 
myself when I feel I can't understand something as told her to not give up. 
Anyways I think I wrote too much already but I wish you guys the best and 
God bless! ...Always remember like in Alma "by small and simple things are 
great things brought to pass"﻿
