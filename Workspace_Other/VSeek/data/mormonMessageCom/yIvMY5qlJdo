For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from 
yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast. 
(Ephesians 2:8, 9 NIV)There is no religion in heaven. JESUS NEVER PREACHED RELIGION !!! Pull out 
the Bible !! The Holy Bible !! The truth will set you free !!!I'm 15 and started reading the Book of Mormon on July 1st. I'm now at the 
end of alma and I love the excitement and inspiration it provides me with. 
As a writer, I find the story of captain Moroni particularly interesting. 
The distraction to the laminites was very clever. The Book of Mormon is my 
favorite book, both because it has changed my life, but also because the 
true stories in it are epic! The Book of Mormon is true, and this I testify 
in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
