Such a pretty dress!I love this, and i do get hate for it and non-fashion. Beautiful message for all women...In Ephesians 2:8,9 the Apostle Paul states, "For by grace are ye saved 
through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of 
works, lest any man should boast." When Paul uses the word "saved," is he 
making a reference to a general resurrection or exaltation?She's so beautiful, a smooth stone in jagged turf.Very Glad that I got to meet more than one chaste young women while I was 
growing up. they had a great effect on me as a young man.
