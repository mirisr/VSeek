I really appreciate how aware he is of non-LDS people's points of view and 
how comfortable he (apparently) is at talking about the church in a 
non-preachy, open-minded way. I think many LDS church members can take a 
lesson from what he says in this interview.Well, this sum's it up! Good job Ruth and Michael! Thanks!
