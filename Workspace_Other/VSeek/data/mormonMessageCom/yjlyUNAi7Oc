Thank you for this video. mww﻿It is urgently essential that everyone gains the will, spiritual and 
physical strength along with the ability to endure to the end, no matter 
what! These are the last days. And our faith will be challenged. But we 
must stay the course and fight the fight. The adversary will do everything 
that we empower him with to make us loose our faith. I know that the 
adversary has no power unless we give it to him. Never dislodge you 
spiritual armor of salvation, never let your guard down. Above all keep the 
faith. Things are going to get much worse than you can even possibly 
fathom. All of us know why we came to earth. It is inherently incumbent 
upon use to return home with and in the full Grace of Our Heavenly Father! 
I share these thoughts with all of you in the loving, merciful and powerful 
name of Jesus Christ, AMEN!﻿
