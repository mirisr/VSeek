Lovely story, thanks﻿Time out for men too.﻿That was a great message about someone's personal experience with 
developing patience. Very applicable.﻿It seems that caring for the ailing mother is an important mission as well. 
﻿My favorite story about patience -

A kid is learning martial arts and his sensei is teaching him various 
forms, blocks, and breathing exercises.  The kids tells the sensei, "this 
is great and all, but when do I learn how to kick and punch, and..."

The sensei calmly responds, "first, you must learn patience."

To which the kid says, "patience, right...How long will that take?"

I find for me, patience is one of the hardest things, particularly when it 
comes to family.  I loved the message of the video.  I think in many ways, 
patience is the art of learning how to keep things in the Lord's 
perspective.﻿I think she is serving a mission, a mission of a different kind. I believe 
there are all kinds of missions some are going out into the fields and 
bringing in investigators, others are missions of mercy and kindness to the 
sick and the afflicted. ﻿
