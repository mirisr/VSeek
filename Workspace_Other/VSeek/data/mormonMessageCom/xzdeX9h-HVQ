Someone cutting onions in here?﻿It's sad how this is the way we are suppose to be and we are but little by 
little it is leaving.
We are becoming colder in SLC 
Mormons are becoming more keep to themselves so please if you are mormon 
please show that is not true. Show it by your dally acts of kindness to 
all.﻿My personal opinion (I'm LDS), but compassionate service should be a 
no-strings-attached act. The service will speak for itself. Maybe a 
pass-along card would be okay (use your own judgement). 

Of course, if the person(s) receiving the help asks questions, then 
explanations and possible invitations are in order.﻿Great video and just as a side note, it's not a Mormon get together without 
the green jello! :) I think the real beauty was that the first step was taken by the little 
girl. bhaha i totally remember watching this in seminary!GOOD VIDEO!I think the man who fed my daughter's family and gave them a car to drive 
until they got theirs fixed must have watched this video and taken it to 
heart.Been on both ends of this video. Great to see it. :D very moveing video, this is what the world needs, together and shareing the 
love of christ god blessCompassion for other's is great! Especially when you follow through with 
it...AMEN!!!That's heartwarming. I wonder why it's called the Abrahamic Covenant?what a great video, I love this one & I've never seen it before. thanks so 
much for uploading it, these videos are doing a lot of good in this world : 
)It's a cute video, but I don't see how it has anything to do with the 
Abrahamic covenant!This is really old fashioned, but this is beautiful. People striving to be 
Christ-like is really an admirable thing, and I'm sure that it makes a real 
difference to those who experience this Christ-like compassion from service.hope they stuck in a copy of the BoM with all that food =)
