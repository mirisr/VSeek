Jesus taught by example
To love those you would to despise
Offer up light to sample
As though they were Him in disguise﻿The righteous, being humble, ask the Lord to explain how and when they 
undertook all of these generous acts and were surprised when He explained 
that when they did it unto the least of His brothers, they did it also unto 
Him.  The wicked, selfish, and arrogant will ask the same question in a 
somewhat different manner:  "when did we fail to do all these things for 
you?"  (in a somewhat defensive manner) and will rationalize their actions 
by saying . . . . ."well, if we only knew that you were the poor in need of 
help, the sick in need of care, the lonely in need of companionship, etc. 
then we would have helped you, but you came in a disguise and we didn't 
know that it was you."    God often comes disguised as a person from whom 
we turn away in disgust but He is waiting to see how we will react.  The 
selfish and the arrogant always give excuses for why they fail to act in a 
generous manner but the humble are always good and not always aware that 
they are helping the Lord.  God is recording our deeds and will repay at 
the appropriate time.  Bless the name of Jesus!!﻿This has been very helpful to me, thanks a bunch!!!!
