what a deep talk. I really like that when read the lines between the lines 
you can see clearly how to improve and what.﻿This is a mature subject for a mature disciple of Christ. To seek and 
accept God's correction - even His painful or confusing correction - is a 
sign of rare understanding.﻿Easily one of my favorite talks. This was my first conference since 
becoming a convert 2 months prior. Being in that conference center and 
hearing them speak was great. These men strengthened my testimony of this 
church so much. I feel as though his experiences apply personally to me. I can see that God 
has a plan for me as an individual.I love the analogy of the gardener. Heavenly Father prunes us for our 
benefit because he loves us. I think that it is important that we are 
humble and accept correction. “As Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten" by 
Elder D. Todd Christofferson is one of my favorite talks of the LDS 2011 
General Conference.
