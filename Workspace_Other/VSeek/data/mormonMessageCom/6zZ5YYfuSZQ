Wonderful disciple of our Savior. His words constantly change my life and 
help me to be a better follower of Christ. Thank you!@gradgurl2007 Good point. Without a realization of the fact that men and 
women hold the priesthood independently of each other there will not be any 
firm fixing of the priesthood in the families, no distribution of power and 
no unlocking of the power of the priesthood till it is fully realized in 
the mind of each brother and sister that authority does not equal power!A good talk about the importance of being worthy to receive and use the 
blessings of the priesthood, whether male or female.Love it. Thanks for the Inspiring words!
