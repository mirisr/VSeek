pride, or something like that, we say these things simply because We've 
prayed to know about this truthness, and certanly God revealed unto us, It 
is true not because someone very smart preached something very interesting, 
I join this church after praying unto God to know and He answer my prayers! 
I Had prayed for weeks and only after my pleadings God answered my prayers 
otherwise I would never had joined this church, you also may know this 
things if you pray sincerely. My dear sister, I would like to ask you, Why is so hard to rely on God? I 
really understand your point of view, sometimes is hard to believe in 
something you're not very acquanted to, however I also believe if you rely 
on God, you will come to know that this church is the only true church on 
Earth, we members of the church don't say " I know this church is true only 
to satisfy...IF THE BIBLE IS THE WORD OF GOD, NOTHING CAN BE ADDED NOR TAKEN OUT. 
WOULDN'T GOD WANT US TO KNOW OF PROPHETS TO COME AFTER JESUS? THEN WHY 
CHRISTIANS ADD PROPHETS TO CHRISTIANITY NOT MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE? AND 
ISN'T A SIN TO WORSHIP, PRAY TO A SO CALLED PROPHET, SAINT, VIRGIN M. AND 
SO ON? WHY SO MANY DO? PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE VISIONS, EXPERIENCES WITH GOD, I 
BELIEVE, BUT TO ADD TO THE WORD OF GOD IS A SIN. JOSEPH SMITH ADDED WHAT 
JESUS COULD HAVE PRIOR TO THE BIBLE BEING SHARED WITH THE WORLDPlease watch this to spiritually prepare to teach and/or participate in 
your next Family Home Evening. I feel The Holy Spirit! I sustain President Monson for sure and agree wholeheartedly that he is as 
good as they say. However, this effusive talk raises some severe red flags 
for me. President Monson (and any other true prophet) would likely condemn 
this hero worship and meekly point instead to Christ, who alone can save.
