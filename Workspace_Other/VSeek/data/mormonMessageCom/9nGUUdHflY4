Even if that person bully you they still 
have good in them and also no one is alone so talk to them why they are 
being mean❓. or tell a grown up to talk to that person and help them see 
and bring out the good 👍. don't leave them just cause they bullied you 
once help them see good so that person can have a good friend like you 💞.

everyone is special to me 💝💟.

~Strawberryswirl🍓﻿Be Kind With The Bully Even If He Is Bad To You.﻿im also been bullying in my school not just boys but also girls﻿So if you beat up the bully is that wrong? Most kids that get bullied play 
victim instead of fighting back / defend themselves. ﻿Just one act of kindness can make all the difference.  It's that simple:)﻿Lil kids these days..﻿Hurt by bullying?
Alma understood how the effects of bullying can be overcome through the 
strengthening power of the atonement of Jesus Christ.*

Here is Alma's prayer for help: "O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may 
have strength, that I may suffer with patience these afflictions which 
shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people" (Alma 31:31).

Alma recognized that some afflictions (like bullying) are a 
naturally-occurring consequence of someone else's choice to not keep the 
commandments of God. He knew that he would suffer (affliction) because of 
the iniquity of the people he was interacting with.

When other people do wrong things, we need help to overcome the effects of 
it.* Alma prayed for strength and comfort to overcome the effects of 
iniquity.

And "the Lord...gave [him] strength, that [he] should suffer no manner of 
afflictions save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. Now this was 
according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith" (Alma 
31:38).

There is a strength and power beyond our own that can come to us because of 
the atonement of Jesus Christ.* Emotional suffering can be swallowed up. An 
inner feeling of calm and comfort can come to us by the power of the Holy 
Ghost as we exercise faith in Jesus Christ.

The Savior knows you individually. He loves you. He knows all the people 
and circumstances around you. Read Alma chapter 31 and discover what 
guidance He has for you.

when he was bulled instead of doing the normal human instinct of getting 
revenge,he showed kindness through pain and was caring to his bully,If more 
people did less negative things against people when have gone through anger 
and pain and instead showed kindness back to the bullies,they would realise 
how horrible they are and think twice about what they do and say to people 
again. ﻿I hate kids getting bully thay should stop bulling at school and kids 
should take a stand﻿No one is that nice.
