The church will be politically neutral but the members are supposed to be 
anything but. We have clear and compelling scriptural statements regarding 
where we are supposed to stand; i.e., Doctrine & Covenants 98, 101, 134; 
Mosiah 29. ETC.I hope you watched the entire video and heard and understood everything 
said sometime after making that comment.I wonder how long the church will be able to maintain its political 
neutrality. Of course the church exists to proclaim the gospel, not to 
elect candidates, as the official statement on neutrality says; but it's 
not hard to see which end of the political spectrum most of those people 
are on who stand with us on the morla issues that have brought the church 
into the political arena, such as Prop. 8 in California.Churches and other nonprofits are strictly prohibited from engaging in 
political campaigning. This prohibition stems from the requirements of 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”).
