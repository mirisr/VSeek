Love you JESUSðŸ’žï»¿Love you JESUSðŸ’žï»¿Today I asked my granddaughter if she wanted to watch a video with animals 
and lambs, instead of waiting for her to ask for youtube videos about 
muÃ±ecas, that often lead to other questionable videos and commercials. We 
sat together and watched and talked about how the shepherds were afraid and 
the angel said "Fear Not". She got excited to see the baby Jesus. She said, 
"I love Jesus" and I said, " I do too. And he loves us." Her little brother 
was content to watch because he is interested in moving the computer mouse. 
I noticed that my granddaughter was much nicer to her brother than usual. I 
continued to turn on the other videos for about an hour and my husband also 
joined in and watched the one about Moses.  It was a pleasant morning.ï»¿Wise men seek Him still !ï»¿Thank you - I love this videoï»¿Amazing!I can't express how much these videos have touched me. I love our Savior, 
Jesus Christ. I love Jesus.>Athiest approves of well made religious video on terms of being extremely 
well made, regardless of belief in it's truthfulness.
