Wow I've been educated thank you!﻿Check out Emergency Essentials. They have tons of stuff for long lasting 
food storage and they are very reasonably priced﻿This legitimately scares me that they decided that now was the right time 
to put this video out O.o ﻿Check your water containers (especially those that are not designed for 
long-term storage) for leaks once in a while. UV rays can breakdown the 
plastic, even through concrete. Over time, I've had three breakdown and 
begin leaking - they were just sitting on the shelf, in my storage.﻿We do this. It works fine. We wash our bottles out in the dishwasher. Large 
water storage tanks are better but can be expensive and not an option for 
some people. I think it is smart to do both. This is a good way to start. ﻿Rotation is Key!﻿Very important.  We lived in a town in Calif that was close to the fires.  
An earthquake took out our city water tanks, and we were without water 
until water trucks drove it up.  Water and light and cold weather clothes 
are two important things to have.﻿I was under the impression that you shouldn't use old plastic containers 
because the plastic wears down and can contaminate the water. Can anyone 
shed some light on this?﻿how many years does it last for ?﻿Cool! I'm totally remembering this﻿This is important to know. You can also use your hot water tank as an 
emergency water supply. When using bottles, write the date on them to be 
able to rotate every few years.﻿
