I love the part where she talks about feeling an immediate impression of 
virtue when she walked by the wedding. This made me feel how holy marriage 
is. I want my marriage & wedding to be focused on virtue and be void of the 
ways of the world. I also like her testimony of the Book of Mormon. I know 
it is the word of God because the Spirit testifies of this to me as I read 
it and as I listen to God's apostles and prophet. The message is nice, I just don't believe the book of Mormon. I don't 
understand how the book of Mormon coincides with the rest of the canonized 
bible...and I don't understand the Mormon doctrine. The gospel explains 
everything to me, I don't see how the book of Mormon can add to it.
