Sorry, I mean Ammonihah..duh!The first time I read the BofM (40 years ago), I thought how horrible how 
terrible it would be to live in a city such as this. Now I realize that now 
the world is this city and is progressing towards destruction just as the 
city of Nephihah was. Sinful people everywhere are trying to reconcile 
their evilness by passing laws to make their sins legal. The great city was 
destroyed in a single day, just as the wicked will be destroyed (in a 
single day) during the 2nd Coming.I love how even in this video, you can see that the angel who tells Alma to 
return to Ammonihah is the same angel who chastised Alma when he was young 
and wicked.Great movie clip!good
