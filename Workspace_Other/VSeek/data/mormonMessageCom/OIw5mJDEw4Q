by the way I'm sister MonestineI feel like a sinner. Today IS Tuesday, July 16, 2013. It IS NOW AROUND 
9:12 p.m.. I feel like a VERY, VERY, VERY HUGE sinner, BECAUSE I have NOT 
said my prayers, since 3 OR 4 weeks, AND I have NOT read my scriptures, 
since 4 OR 5 weeks ago. I AM a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter Day Saints. I NEED to start reading my scriptures, AND I NEED to 
start praying, EVERYDAY. I NEED YOUR help! I NEED EVERYONE'S help! PLEASE 
help! Maybe I SHOULD start, TOMORROW! Thanks! Bye! :)Such a beautiful song and a very beautiful subject! Our prayers are so 
important.wow..es emocionante la delicadeza del himno...y tú...¿Pensaste orar?...
