This man is one of the Lord's greatest prophets.﻿Sure missed him. ﻿the Sacred Grove is where it all began it was here 12 year old Joseph saw 
the lord and was proclaimed a prophet and it was here where our great 
church began   ﻿He became a part of every person who ever listened and watched him. An 
angel on earth now sits at the right hand of our older brother Jesus 
Christ. I will never stop loving President and sister Hinckley nor will any 
one else I bet!miss u. and hope to see uhe is so awesome and inspiring!every time i listen to any of his talks he ever gave i makes me realize how 
much i miss him and cant wait to see him again in the after life....you 
were the best prophet and i was very glad to be in this church I'll miss him everyday for the rest of my life!
