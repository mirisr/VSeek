Love this song, but the conductor was too dramatic.My Favourite Hymn. Well one of my many :D Beautiful choir Very inspiring; one can feel The Spirit testify of the Love of Jesus and 
His Atonement, and our Loving Father in Heaven's Plan of Salvation. This was the first hymn I ever learned all the way through, when I sang it 
in a Primary chorus in a stake conference when I was 7 or 8.this version kicks butt!that's a beautiful song and that's a good performance.thank you for your 
efforts and your sacrifices. I played this hymn on Sunday for our intermediate hymn. Beautiful. I love 
when the youth sing. I could really feel the spirit when watching this :)this song makes me feel so happy! it's beautiful :)
