Actually, my parents used allowance with me. It's not safe for every child 
to be selling things (it certainly wasn't in the area of Houston I grew up 
in), though my Mom did have "extra jobs" I could do around the house for 
extra allowance. She also didn't want to tie chores to my allowance because 
she said that begets the "I did my chores, so I won't help anymore" 
attitude. She wanted me to help when asked, and I did. She also wanted me 
to learn to manage money, and I did, in my opinion.Who are the Eyres, and do they have a plan or program that they recommend 
or implement in this parenting topic?
