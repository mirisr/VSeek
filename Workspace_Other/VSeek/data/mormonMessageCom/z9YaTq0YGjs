Congrats on your YouTube channel! This will be a great way to make content 
available to those around the world who might not otherwise have access to 
it. Am Morrison am very much excited for this music.Am proud to be a mormon 
from Ghana who are mormon tell me about you this is great im so excited how do i subscribeI watched some of the choirs concerts on Youtube. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
If you ever come to Sydney I'll have to try and get tickets.Awesome! I'm so excited to be able to watch the choir from Kuwait! I always wanted to sing with Mormon Tabernacle choir. I now discover that 
my 60 years of life (traumatic brain injury, aside) puts me outside the 
eligibility requirements for choir membership, so, I guess I will just have 
to do it with slightly more difficulty, as a guest of the Mormon Tabernacle 
Choir! I will just try to remember , "to whom much is given, much is 
expected.". Lastly, "until we meet again", all my love and admiration to 
every single member of the Choir . It is very interesting knowing more about the members of the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir. We only happen to see them on TV most of the time, and it 
is great to know a little about it members. Thanks for sharing it, 
especially to those who live abroad. I was touched that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir touch the old people at an 
assisted living home. I too have been lifted spiritually during my health 
challenges. You have given me faith and hope.Love to see the choir jumping on Google + Technology is a great way to 
reach more people and spread the happiness!When it said MTC Live Chat, I thought it meant Missionary Training Center 
chat with the missionaries. *CaryMy uncle Carey Belt is in the choir! This is awesome! lolWow that is so awesome :3 I wanna tour with the choir! Some day :3sso cool!! lol :PGreat to see the Mormon Channel doing a hangout on air! Hopefully there are
