Joining the church at the age of 17 has opened vistas of happiness and joy 
that I never knew existed when I was yet an atheist. Heavenly Father and 
Jesus Christ love me in ways I could not understand. There are times that I 
do not deserve it but it is constantly there.., I am so happy to be member 
of The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints.. =)
