just standing. We need to be actively engaged in good causes. Here's to a 
better, brighter, and more actively engaged New Year! Gotta remember not to watch these at school. Tearing up like crazy. Love 
these videos. What's in the mormon messages that always makes me cry ?We are excited for the Strength of Youth Media!InspiringWere they wearing skirts?I love that question at the end. really makes you think about life. And 
really that question apply s to all of life.I am so thankful that my oldest son (12 years old) is alive at this 
exciting time in the Earth's history. There is such good in the world and I 
know that he and many others like him have been sent to earth as a positive 
force for good. I'm excited for the teaching helps and resources of the 
Church and how they help us to live the gospel of Jesus Christ.
