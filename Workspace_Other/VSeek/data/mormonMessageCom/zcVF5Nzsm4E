those kids did so well sitting so reverently throughout the whole session. 
and is it me or did it look like one of the cameramen was having a giggle 
after the shot of the yawning kid (notice the camera jiggling slightly??) I 
don;t know how those things work but it looked funny. cute kid, great 
choir, my favourite session of hymns!I like this song. This choir did a VERY beautiful job, with singing this. 
At the 2:00 minute mark, of the video, I liked it, when the cute little 
boy, had to yawn. General Conference makes me, tired, also! :) Children are 
so cute and innocent. LET US ALL LOVE EVERYONE! LET US ALL LOVE OUR FAMILY 
AND KIDS! WE NEED MORE LOVE, ON EARTH! LET US LOVE EVERYONE! LET US LOVE 
OUR FAMILY! WE NEED MORE LOVE, ON EARTH! I love this song. Thanks for 
posting. This is a beautiful arrangement. Good job Jane Fjelsted! Such an amazing chorister. Beautiful song and the 
arrangement was beautiful as well. Definitely one of my favorite hymns, if not my favorite hymnI live in Roy and I saw my friends from semenary there and my old bishop 
there too.True feeling of the true church :)
