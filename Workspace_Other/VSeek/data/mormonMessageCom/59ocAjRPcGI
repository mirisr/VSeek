What a beautiful talk. We must be diligent and always trust in the Lord. He 
will never let us down.ï»¿I just got the Aaronic Priesthood and this is great preperation for me as a 
new convert at the age of 20 planning on going on a mission in a year.Teaching RS on this talk tomorrow! So great, but a little difficult to make 
applicable to women :) I got this!Amazing. So many things spoke straight to me. What a miracle and blessing 
it is to have these messages brought to us through this medium. Thank you!And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who 
were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, 
or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon 
riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond 
and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, 
having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need. (Alma 1:30.)Thank you so much for sharing this!
