Great video, God bless !This is so funny, but so true! No one said technology. I'm Thankful for Heavenly Father and that he loves us all regardless of our 
faith. I'm grateful to know he truly knows us and of our needs no matter 
big or small. He is always willing to bless us if we do what is right 
always.I am thankful for knowing that God loves me.Im thankful that I came to see the God of the bible and left mormonism. I 
have a lot of great friends that are mormon, but mormonism isnt the 
Christianity which is what the bible teaches. Im not here to pick a fight 
and im sure my post will be deleted and Im willing to talk with anyone but 
the Mormon god is not the God of the bible. I hope those that see this do 
there research :) God blessI am thankful that God is not a man that he should lie, and who existed 
from eternity past and in our begining made man in his image. That I am 
reconciled to God the father through christs self sacrifice, and his grace 
by which I believed and am saved.I love watching this video when I'm feeling unhappy. It always lifts my 
spirits. Did anyone else notice how all those people looked happy as they 
were talking about things they are thankful for? Gratitude definitely makes 
us happier.I am so grateful for the Prophet and the Apostles, especially Elder Oaks, I 
met that man and he was the nicest person I had ever met:) I'm thankful for the power of the Aaronic Priesthood which I behold and all 
my priesthood members, and I'm thankful for my callings as a teacher in the 
Aaronic Priesthood... I could go on but there are many things I'm thankful 
for!I needed this video for my english homework :PI am thankful for my family.@AOGLDSMember92510 Amen :)This video was a wonderful reminder for my family this Thanksgiving day of 
how much we have to be thankful for. It is worth 4 minutes of your time 
today.[[[ Everyone! Thumbs Up this comment so it'll be noticed please! ]]] If you 
were in this video, and see this message, email me! I'm a beginning 
filmmaker and would like to do a catchup version of this someday (unless 
the church is already planning on doing so...), but need to get in contact 
with everyone. Thanks! :]I like counting my blessings... simply because it makes me happy to 
recognize all that god blesses us with in small and simple ways from day to 
day and to give him something small in return. :)I think i be thankful for my problems and challenges cus even though I hate 
them and it sucks when they pop outta nowhere, it's those challenges that 
make me who I am and help me know who is really there to support me when I 
need them most.This is my favorite Mormon message... I watched it years ago.. and it's 
still my favorite.I am thankful for still feeling the love of god, although IÂ´ve made so many
