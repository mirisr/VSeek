my language﻿its s9o good to see that the world still has alot of good in it. This story 
is so heart warming.﻿What a gentleman and a survivor! I admired his attitude and his generosity! 
I know that with the Saviour by our side, we can always have hope and 
achieve a better future. Thanks Mormon channel for a great video!!﻿That is so heart warming. God bless this selfless man to stay strong and 
stand together with his family and town.﻿Beautiful to see.﻿I love this! I had the chance to visit Tacloban last year. The recovery is 
slow going but the Filipino spirit endures! Great message :)﻿This is great! Give back and don't let circumstances from keeping you from 
doing so.﻿viver para chorar e reerguer semiando.﻿
