I love this dreamThank You!!awesome !! Thanks for putting this on Youtube!Lehi dreams about the Christ.In my personal journey I have found that the ''great and spacious 
building'' could represent all of those thoughts and voices that come to 
your mind that tell you that you're not good enough, that you're weird, or 
that you should be ashamed of your desires to know truth, and to know 
God.... Make a strong commitment to reject that voice--to refuse it. Don't 
tolerate it. Keep trying. From time to time, you'll have to tolerate 
disrespect from others, but never tolerate it from yourself.coolReminds me of the illustrated books I had from my parents as a kid. I like 
this.sweet
