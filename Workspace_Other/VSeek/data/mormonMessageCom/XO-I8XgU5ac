In times of trouble or strife, its so refreshing to know we can turn back 
to the father in heaven, his son, and the holy ghost for a well needed 
uplift in spiritual strength. This song, is my spiritual uplift.ï»¿I love the Mormon tabernacle choir and I know that the church of Jesus 
Christ of latter day saints is the only true church on the face of the 
earth! Other churches have some truth but we have the full restored gospelï»¿Exquisite!
