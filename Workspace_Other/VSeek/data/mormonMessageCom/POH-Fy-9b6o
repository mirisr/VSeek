She never left the testimony about her husband. The fact that she did not 
go West does not mean she went rebellious at all. We must not judge her. 
Only God can do it. For instance, I went inactive in the Church but the 
Church will always be a part of my life. I wish I could come back but I 
lack self-steem to do so. ï»¿Thanks for sharing this video of Emma Smith, truly a remarkable and 
courageous woman.This is great and shows a side of her we seldom think of. She never had a 
real home for very long and was driven from place to place. She had a 
testimony of the work.
