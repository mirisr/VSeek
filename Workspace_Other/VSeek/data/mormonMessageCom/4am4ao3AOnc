9:27 I know that this works for a fact. I'm one of those people who, 
sharing the gospel comes naturally to me. Just today, I had been asked to 
give a 3 minute talk. I never wrote it down, but I kept it in my heart and 
thought about what he wanted me to say. I never wrote anything down, and 
when I stood up and opened my mouth, the words just found their way out. 
It's truly an incredible experience. Oh, and don't ever think you're too 
young for it, I'm only 15.
