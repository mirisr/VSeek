You never stand alone when you stand with your father in heaven ﻿Food to my soul.﻿I love this story!
Navy boot camp was not easy for me
Nor for anyone who endured it
Oft I thought my life was in jeopardy
The drills demanding but true grit

As the first Sunday rolled around
We were called forth by our Petty Officer
We stood at attention on the drill ground
And our dismissal for church was made official

In the brisk California breeze
The call to religious duty was given
First the Catholics and Jews were released
Then the Protestants, till I was alone even

Here I dared to stand seeking for God's help
When the Petty Officer said to me
"What do you call yourselves?"
And.... "Mormons" was heard in synchronicity

Yes. You are never truly alone
When the call for courage is made
You have the Lord, by whom you are known
And others behind you carefully laid﻿What a wonderful talk! :) It's good to hear the words of our prophet! :) ﻿I do know that the priesthood is a power of God given to men to serve His 
children upon the earth.
