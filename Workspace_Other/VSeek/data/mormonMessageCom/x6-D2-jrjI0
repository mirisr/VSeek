Love President Monson!﻿what a wonderful time we live when God does communicate with his children﻿Awesome ...... Wonderful speech. I waiting so much for next general 
conference ......Wow. I cried. I cried so much. I'm a recent convert, used to quietly tease 
how I could tell when I was at Mormon church because of all of the crying. 
Well, now it's not just Mormon church, it's my church too, and that's my 
president speaking, and he was talking about one of my missionaries who has 
had his life forever changed because of his faith in and service to God.... 
Anyone who's watching this probably already knows.... but it's real. All of 
it, it's true.
