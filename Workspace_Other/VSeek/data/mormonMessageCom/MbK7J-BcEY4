of all of Father Lehi's sons only Nephi obeyed the Lord many times Laman 
and Lemuel tried to kill Nephi but they got reprimanded by Father Lehi.

to be wicked and because of it 4,000 generations of Native American's have 
left the church we are trying to bring them back and the Book of Mormon 
will help with that.  ï»¿haha Yes people. Please understand this is for Children or for a overview.
