power whom He must understood and learnt, how to become whom he is now, we 
as humans are not given enough understanding to understand hihger laws and 
principles, the ones that governs the Gods of the Universe, there is not 
such a semantic or pragmatic significant definitions, to help us understand 
a different and powerfull word, than the word "God"..ï»¿Guilt is to our spirit, what pain is to our body. When we are following the 
right path we feel joy and are at peace. When we feel guilt we better look 
to see where we need to repent.He is rightBut the world thinks otherwise, why talking about this topic? God will help 
us be chaste when it s difficult for us to obey it .Thanks for your speech!I <3 this talk & speaker! Elder Bednar is truly inspiring! Just looking at 
him makes me want to go explore my scriptures because he has such a wealth 
of knowledge & I want the same :) He's so sure, & correct in teaching and 
gives beautifully written talks Something I found interesting while 
listening to this over & over again is that it's been educational to listen 
to it from different circumstances. Such as a gay point of view, or an old 
immobile person, a person with mental problems, etc.please...leave it out of your vlog Shay.He said it, "Progress to exaltation", meaning to become a god...Hmmm, Satan 
wanted the same thing...Christians don't believe this for there will always 
be One God who we praise and worship period. He is our everything... The voice of a true prophet of the Lord is the Word of God, is the voice of 
God, is the mind of God, is God's will for us, his children...He is a true 
prophet of the Lord!
