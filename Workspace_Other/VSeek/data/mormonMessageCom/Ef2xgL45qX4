Thank you so much for such a heart touching song﻿Meu hino favorito sempre quando eu ouço sinto a presença de Deus.﻿Thank you Heavenly Father for blessing us with the restoration :)﻿i feel like someone coughs at the beginning of every one of these hymn 
videos lol﻿I love listening to this choir though I am not a Mormon....beautiful﻿Master, the tempest is raging. Beautiful music video.Piano﻿Mack Willberg's arrangement captures the emotion of the lyrics perfectly.Inspirational choir.I always remember being young and thinking that the organ player had three 
hands. The idea always kinda scared me lolThis was so awesome. I was immediately captivated by it when I saw it! =)
