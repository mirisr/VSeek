I wish the MC would post comments. People could discuss the theme. With 
Elder Hinckley at first I thought it was nepotism in his calling, but when 
you watch the video interviews and feel the testimony,you can see what a 
great man he is in his own right and know the Lord has called him. He 
displays the composure and style that would suit a terrific political 
leader. If Mitt Romney would have copied the composure and class of Elder 
Hinckley he probably would have been President yesterday.It's so true. The growth is the challenge in the Church.
