That's the first time I've ever heard someone say that.I'm athiest. I still listen to Monson and Joel Osteen. They're just amazing 
amd incredible people. Look up to this man.great for me!!!!This man speaks the truth... spot on!Good one!The 3 R's of Choice. Come Listen to a Prophet's Voice and Hear the Word of 
God. I hope the Church posts some Gordon B. Hinckley talks as well, gotta 
remember that "giant among men".Very helpful in enlightening to our view the power in foreseeing the 
consequences of our choices. It helps us make correct choices to follow Our 
Saviourâ€™s Love - the path He made possible for all his Children, As he 
beckoned all to 'Come follow Me'."Let us not find ourselves as indecisive."I love that, "make the right choice 100% of the time, not 98%." So 
important; it makes all the difference. I can think of very specific 
incidents in my life where that applies. Thank you, dear Prophet!with every choice we make we choose the cup we drink from death or life... 
its really a spiritual walk. i choose the straight and narrow. there be 
that find it but i shalbe one of the few! will you?great meeting. Beautiful insights
