my fav song!﻿What a blessing to be part of this great work i cant wait someday so soon 
to be part of that great gathering even at the conference centre﻿Look at the glow on the choir member's faces! ﻿good﻿It's soooo nice to hear the 21.000 LDS Christians with the 360 MoTab Choir 
sing the song "There is Sunshine in my soul today" in this magnificence 
Conference Center! I imagine how it would be in heaven! May God bless your 
ministry! we did not know it was going to have a fourth verse of this hymn. Here in 
Brazil we just have three verse for this hymn..., but it was good! 
wonderful!
