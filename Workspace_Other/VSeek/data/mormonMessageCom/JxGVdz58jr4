Thank you for this message, Elder Oaks.  Very instructive and powerful in 
it's content.ï»¿Why wouldnt the Lords will be to heal is faithfu children who have long 
suffered I have received many Priesthood blessings throughout my life. I am still 
here because of these blessings. Even more importantly, they have helped me 
to do the things that I should do, needed to do, and wanted to do. We are 
so lucky that the Lord has restored His priesthood power to the Earth and 
that we can receive blessings from Him through those ordained to use His 
power. These Priesthood blessings are available to all people who sincerely 
seek them from the Elders of the LDS church. Thank you Elder Oaks for this wonderful, instructive address. It answered 
many questions I've had in my mind for some time. One of my favorite messages ever. Should be a must-view for anyone 
requested or giving a blessing. I can't believe they allow comments for 
these videos. Lots of meanies out there. Anyway, Oaks is one of my favorite 
speakers. He never wastes a word. :)I'm so glad this is on youtube. Is it alllowed?Love the truth that is spoken by him!
