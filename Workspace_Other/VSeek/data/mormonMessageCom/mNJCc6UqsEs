I love being Mormon I love this hymn.﻿How comforting...."all that was promised...will be given...and they will be 
crowned withe the angels..."﻿also me ilike this song :))﻿If you believe in God, then love the God within and then love your neighbor 
as you love the God within. (The Kingdom of Heaven is within). It's that 
simple. You don't need old wine and CASH tithes to pay for salvation like 
the wicked Jews and sold salvation for CASH money. Then Jesus said the 
Kingdom if Heaven is within and salvation is free. That's why the Jews had 
Jesus murdered. They had the love of money in their forehead and NOT the 
love of thy neighbor. :)﻿If you believe in God, then love the God within and then love your neighbor
