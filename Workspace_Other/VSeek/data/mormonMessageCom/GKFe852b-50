its so beautiful and reassuring to see the representation of a healthy 
black family by the church. Like this is so needed and necessary. Also the 
message of blending families is so useful and informative. This is so 
lovely. I'm so happy I came across this video.﻿"the bed is made of a giant sponge" lol <3﻿Having blended my own family, I understand the challenges.  I also agree 
that "step" family has been given such a bad wrap. You may not have 
psychically created these children but you are capable of loving and having 
them fill spaces in your heart you weren't aware were empty. We are ALL 
God's children and should try harder to see each other in that respect.﻿So cute!﻿I became an instant mom to three wonderful kids when I got married. It has 
been a special challenge to be the second mom to these wonderful kids. We 
have since added two more kids to our happy home and I have learned so much 
about myself and all of God's children by becoming a "Second Mom" before I 
had my own biological children. What a wonderful journey this life is!﻿I love how this family work as team work what great there own ,,beautiful﻿Beautiful family! ﻿Beautiful! ﻿flexibility is key﻿
