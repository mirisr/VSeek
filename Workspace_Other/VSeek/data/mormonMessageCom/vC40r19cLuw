The temple is a beautiful & special place where we can receive great 
blessings from Heavenly Father through participating in temple ordinances! 
 My husband & I are both converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints!  I was both baptized & received my ordinances some years 
ago, but my husband was not yet ready!  This past weekend, my husband 
finally received his endowments, followed by our being sealed for time & 
eternity in the temple!  I know that these ordinances will prove to be a 
great blessing in our lives, as they will for anyone who accepts the gospel 
& takes upon themselves these sacred ordinances!  <3﻿Strength comes from within... If a person is confident it does not matter 
who or what they believe in. It's a drive and motivation that gives 
strength. Believing in your dreams! Wonder why so many scientists continue 
on even when things fail? because they have drive, and they don't give up. 
It does not matter if you're religious or atheist or agnostic. blessings will come upon our heads if we frequently do sacred ordinances in 
the temple..God lives and loves us so much..great video I'm so glad that we have a modern day prophet to guide and 
build up the LDS churchLindo video, sobretodo el mensaje del Elder Scott: "Cuando guardamos los 
convenios que hemos hecho en el templo... seaa lo que fuera que venga no 
tenemos razón para preocuparnos".good stuff!!!Thank you for this neat video.This could be edited to 1 minute and get across the same message better. Where in the Bible or the BOM do we find the rituals of temple marriage and 
eternal families?Such a wonderful message. The road can be so long and you can feel defeated 
many times, but we are never alone in our struggles. The Lord blesses us 
for our endurances, and He loves us. There is absolutely nothing more beautiful than a daughter of God who Puts 
her Father in Heaven first.
