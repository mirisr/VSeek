i dont agree with Mormonism but the videos are good﻿As I listened to voice of Jesus when said " Young man rise up", that 
brought chill to my body....I love you my Lord & savior Jesus﻿I love this; it is one of my most cherished of all Bible stories since I 
was a child.﻿So glad to be a christian! JESUS You are the Way﻿It was cool how the dead man's face changed in color when he was healed. 
Very cool to see these. I love how the script is SCRIPTure :)﻿The actor that plays this Jesus always looks like such a boss when he walks 
away after a miracle. So cool. haha﻿interesting﻿Could He perhaps of thought
Of His own widow, His mother
And His own feelings fought
As He lifted up another﻿I am not a Mormon but as I've studied these videos, no Christian need be 
afraid for I've found nothing to be unbiblical. Watch and EXAMIN each 
yourself. Don't take my word. Watch one at a time and read the scriptures 
yourself. ﻿How can we get eternal life? Jhon3:16
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son Jesus christ, 
that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.﻿

very soon ..........﻿Tears of great sorrow
Can change unto joy
Look towards tomorrow
Where faith and hope join﻿
