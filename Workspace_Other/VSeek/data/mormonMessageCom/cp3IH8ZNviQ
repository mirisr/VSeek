слез﻿с пальто он так и остался на улице﻿well done, thanks for sharing﻿Great video!﻿I am not sure about anyone else, but to learn about a true experience from 
the life of a prophet is so inspiring, and really helps the lesson of "it 
is better to give than to receive" become an important part of or lives.

you do with your life is your gift to God."﻿Touching! This Holiday Season, do some good deeds...﻿Love this true story about charity.﻿Made me cry a litle so kind best vido ever﻿:D﻿1 John 3:17-18  whoso hath this worlds good, and see's his brother or 
sister in need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how 
dwelleth the love of God in him?  My little children, let us not love in 
word, neither in tongue: but in deed, in spirit, and in truth.﻿Poor kid!﻿The animation, music and message touch my heart like few others. To the 
producers - thank you for lifting me up and bringing a measure of love and 
inspiration into my life.I am addicted!, how do I cure this sickness, I watch, I cry, I laugh with 
joy and then I go to another... please help me stoppppp looking through 
windows is my favorite but their are so many others how do I choose?i watch this once a week.It's an original composition for the animation by Jenny McCaffreyDoes anyone know what the music in this video is? i love this storyunfortunately, the scum of the earth (the rich, the proud, and the 
abominable; the wicked) ...oh, how disappointing. :( i love this story it is my favorite oneAmo questo video è un esnempio di speranza ed amore per chi non riesce ad 
essere migliore..... fratelli e sorelle vi vogliamo benetime is short((, but I believe that we succeedMateus 25:40 I used this video in primary class this Sunday. Children love it :)I wish I knew what this song was called! What a Beautiful piece. @steven john When you love and serve others, it's like your loving and 
serving Christ.. we, all of us, are His brothers and sisters.. if He's 
here, He'd give us what He has also..He's that loving :-)Because i have been given much, i too must give :-) Much is given, much is 
required..doing good will make you no harm :-)Was the mom angry? No. May all of our lives be like this!Everytime I tear up :') The charity and love a little child can be so 
profound :) Love this storyHow?If I may correct you.... Yes, there are many things that make no sense in 
this world. But there is one thing that I believe is certain: If everyone 
was kindly this world would be, not full of weak people, but peaceful and 
free of war caused by those competing for power and resources. Charity 
leads to happiness. Doing good feels good. Selfishness leads to misery. 
Doing bad feels bad. Simple.brought tears to my eyes :')! amazing cartoon. really have enjoyed both, should do more This is so amazing. <3 Also, does anyone know how I can get this song? 
Thanx:) Good video I like it.how can the charity make a better world? it has no sense, if everybody was 
kindly this world would be full of weak people, the world needs the 
smartest richest and strongest to compete for power and resources, if 
everybody had everything they need, nobody would compete, there would exist 
no inventions, no arts, we would be living just with the necesary to live, 
maybe that would be good for ones, but i want more for myselfGreat video!my sister loves it every time.Lindo video.Why did they leave the boy out in the cold? According to the scripture 
quoted at the end this is what you've done to Christ... you left him out in 
the cold. Such a touching and very well done animation, how could anyone dislike 
this? Watching this makes me want to be a kinder person.I wish I had the music to this.. beautiful.I listen to this nearly everyday on my ipod, replaying this story in my 
head when I'm at school. I love having this reminder of charity around :')When my brother asked why I give so much in charity, I showed him this 
video :)The Mormon church made this. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day 
Saints. You can go to lds.org to find out more about it.What song is played?soo touching... i wish my daughter will do the same as he did.Since I was converted, I learn to love and give important to others. Always 
(CTR)Thank you for such uplifting videos. They are such a sweet spot especially 
at this time of year.Not just teared...cried. This was so touching...WONDEFUL! Exactly what the Savior would do. the music is so great in this. Um primoroso exemplo da prática do compartilhar e da compaixão. Lindo!You can read this story in "Lesson 13: Jesus Christ Heals the Sick," in 
Primary 7: New Testament, (1997), pg. 44–46: lds [dot] 
org/manual/primary-7-new-testament/lesson-13-jesus-christ-heals-the-sick?lang=eng&query=heber+grant+coat 
That manual gives the following citation: Adapted from “The Coat,” retold 
by Lucile C. Reading, Children’s Friend, Nov. 1966, p. 5.The best cartoon ever. From a Persian Muslim. God bless you allI am so﻿ touched by this. A very simple video that has a very deep meaning. 
SO NICE <3So simple and touching. What are we willing to give to others? good boy ^^Thank you for this sweet simple portrayal of love and compassion. Isn't 
this exactly why our Savior wants us to be as little children?
