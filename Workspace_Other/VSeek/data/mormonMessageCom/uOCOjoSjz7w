Excellent video. Preservation of the scriptures is a very important task. 
This is in stark contrast to the history of the Bible, where it was formed 
from over 25,000 writings which were from believers and not from the 
original authors (Prophets / Apostles). Preservation is from corruption, 
which is by revelation, to ensure only God's truth is entered. This is the 
practice of the Apostles in the New Testament and continues today with the 
Apostles of the LDS Church. Amen.
