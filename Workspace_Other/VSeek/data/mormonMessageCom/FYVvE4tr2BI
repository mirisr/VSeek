Dang haters.﻿butiful video﻿I believe ALL of us will be bullied sometime in life. I don't think it has 
a lot to do with physical appearance, smarts, wealth, or athletisism - even 
people I think are really great in these areas get bullied, too. I have to 
remember we are children of God. We are loved and adored by Him. I was 
bullied by loved ones and school mates alike. I was bullied everywhere I 
went. All because of my "looks." I thought I was beautiful, but the world 
told me I was ugly. THEY were soooo wrong! I went to commit suicide, but a 
desperate prayer stopped me from doing it. From that point in my teens, til 
now, in my later ages, everytime I do something wonderful in my life, I am 
always reminded to look back at that time that I almost took my life 
because I thought the world did not want me or need me. Over the years I 
have influenced many people; been a youth leader to hundreds of teens; a 
school teacher; a friend; an aunt; a wife; a mother. All of these roles are 
important and have shown me my worth. If I had taken myself out of the 
world because of someone else's stupid and false message to me of who they 
carelessly thought I was, I would not have the joy I have now. If you are 
there now, just let me represent your future self and say: YOU ARE PERFECT 
FOR JUST WHO YOU ARE - YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD! ...that's the real truth!﻿this made me cry my head of!﻿This is so sad 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢﻿i would never take my life ..... because i have something to live for dont

it shows how both the bullies and the bullied can change for the better.
