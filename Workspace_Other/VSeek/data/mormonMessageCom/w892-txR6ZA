True Dat.Is scary how much these mormons come off as regular Evangelical Christians.It's good to know that I'm not the only one who has these problems. I have 
found it hard to share my beliefs to my friends without being too preachy 
or arrogant in ways. I think it's good to show, by example, how you live 
your life and let others see with their eyes what they can do to improve 
theirs. If only everyone's eyes could be opened to the truth as mine have 
been over the years. Thanks for the inspiration to share the gospel.Great Ideas. Thanks!!!
