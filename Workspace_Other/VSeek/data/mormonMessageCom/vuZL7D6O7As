Such a powerful video amazing﻿This was by far the most moving one. I am so touched by this man's story.
I also happen to be a great lover of music, and the beautiful violin in

a wonderful example to all who see this!﻿Unbelievable. This story hits in a way that is difficult to describe. Such 
a witness to the declaration of doing all things through Christ.﻿We all either know an addict, have been an addict, or are in danger of 
becoming one. Thank God for a church that hears the cry for help and is 
ready to assist in every way possible and is ready to have that

ever needs to be alone. Jesus always has His arms outstretched.﻿The experiences you faced were absolutely heartbreaking, Aram. Your
