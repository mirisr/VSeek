"One day we will look back at our lives and wonder if we could have been 
better, made better decisions, or used our time more wisely. To avoid some 
of the deepest regrets of life, it would be wise to make some resolutions 
today." —Dieter F. Uchtdorf﻿"No matter our circumstances, no matter our challenges or trials, there is 
something in each day to embrace and cherish."﻿He is a true apostle of God. What a great talk. Thank you President 
Uchtdorf.
