These videos are amazing anyone struggling with Pornography addiction 
should watch these and let then lord make your weaknesses your strength and 
use the internet to increase your faith and knowledge of the gospel﻿Thanks!﻿Would you destroy a temple
Where God's spirit resides?
Spiritually we're His people-.
to be holy besides!﻿This video so beautifully teaches what has often become forgotten in 
today's world. The nessity of living the law of chastity because we have 
been created after the image of God. Unfortunately this commandment is 
mocked & made light of in our world. This video helps me to remember who I 
am God's son & the need to keep his commandments.﻿I love this scripture because it helps me understand that that my body is a 
Temple and that I should treat it as a holy gift from God.﻿Wow; I love this set of verses.﻿I really like these videos, but something about the voice audio takes me 
out of the experience occasionally. It sounds like it was recorded in a 
studio, not there on set. I think it'd be better with an on-set take.﻿Thank you for the video and may god bless you!!!!!﻿
