I agree with a post made on another Mormon video. I believe there are 
people who surf YouTube for anything Mormon and without even listening to 
the message automatically click the dislike icon. How anyone of any faith 
or any background can listen to these messages, which are so positive and 
uplifting and meant to be just that for all people, and dislike them simply 
for there content is beyond me. These are people that have been poisoned by 
the philosophies of men.
