A project we worked on to help spread the gospel :) : 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbVNu9QPMLA﻿Two Mormon missionaries converted me from Christianity to atheism. I very 
nearly joined the LDS, but my investigation into Smith, the early church, 
and the Book of Mormon led me to the the conclusion that both were a fraud. 
This caused me to critically think about my own faith in the Bible and i 
came to a similar conclusion.  ﻿I am grateful for my Heavenly Father and his infinite capacity to love.﻿Elder Bednar should have put the #MissionaryLogo across the big screen, and 
feel Aw!!!!!﻿
