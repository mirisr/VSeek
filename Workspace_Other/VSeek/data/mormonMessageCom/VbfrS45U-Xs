Believe in Lord Jesus Christ with trusting faith and you shall be saved. 
God Bless﻿amen﻿It's " Boss Time." ﻿I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU.EVEN THEY KNOW THE SCRIPTURES WELL. UNFORTUNATELY 
HUMAN BEINGS STILL DOUBT JESUS AND TREATING HIM AS A PREACHER/TEACHER. THAT 
IS WHY, JESUS IS TELLING, IF YOU BELIEVE,EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE. 'YOU ARE 
BELIEVING GOD, BELIEVE ALSO ME 'SAYS THE LORD. I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, THE 
LIFE AND THROUGH ME ONLY, YOU WILL REACH THE KINGDOM OF GOD.yaaaaa hope In Exodus 4 Moses doubted his own ability to free Israel. But God's wisdom 
in who He chooses is greater than our own. God chooses specific people who 
he trusts to become prophets and apostles. These people are elected by God 
because of their obedience and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Anyone that 
God chose could have translated the Book of Mormon. God wisely selected the 
prophet Joseph Smith to be entrusted with the protection and translation of 
this additional sacred record of Jesus Christ. Someone else could have, but Joseph was there, prepared and willing. So he 
did it. God told Joseph once or twice that if he didn't keep His 
commandments, he would be replaced by someone else. Joseph was not 
important simply because he was Joseph, but became important when he chose 
to do what God told him to do. God will raise up the righteous. Whether you're from this dimension, or from one unseen....when the Savior 
speaks YOU listenSomeone else could have. But Joseph was there, prepared and willing. He 
showed that while he endured many persecutions but remained true to his 
mission. It was a great learning experience for him that prepared him for 
the things he would do later. This was an awesome portrayal of this story. I was very impressed. Jesus 
Christ is the Healer of our souls if we could just come to him truly 
seeking his comfort.Even the devils knew who Jesus was, and confessed that He is the "Holy One 
of God", because of their previous knowledge from the pre-existence, before 
they were cast out of Heaven, along with Lucifer. Jesus is triumphant. Check out the link in the description. There you can watch and download the
