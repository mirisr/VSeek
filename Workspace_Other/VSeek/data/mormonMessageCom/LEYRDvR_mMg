I remember one distric conference we had here in Nelson New Zealand, our 
Mission President got all full time Missionaries up to the stand and all 
the prospective missionaries and young men 14 and up to Stand together and 
Sing called to serve unacompanied and by the end of the first verse it was 
so hard to sing the seccond, the spirit filled everyones heart, then our 
mission presdient said we are all called to serve the Lord, no mater who we 
are. Members are called to serve...I've loved singing this song since I went on my mission, and still belt it 
out with great joy and faith! Thanks for posting!I <3 this song!!!
