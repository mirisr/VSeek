#Faith﻿The wake up call
Comes from within
After you fall
And prayers begin﻿In greater light
We can see
What comes of Christ
For tasting﻿Taste the light of truth
Goodness nourishes
A witness is proof
Love then flourishes.
Through opposition
Light is found
To re-position
On good ground.
In greater light
You see more clearly
What's in plain sight
And treat it dearly.﻿Where are you on the faith spectrum?
On a scale from one to ten.
The first step to have? a speck of
Belief to act on often.
Thank you Elder Robbins.  There's a lot here to ponder.﻿love light!  I open the blinds and drapes of our home every morning, to let 
in the light of a blessed, new day.  In the same manner, I invite the 
Lord's Light into my soul by prayer, scripture study, review of the words 
of living prophets, apostles, seventies, and loving service to my family, 
and Granite Hills Ward, and El Cajon community.  I use Light to polish the 
Lamp of my testimony, to keep it shining brightly.  My Lambda Delta Sigma 
advisor taught us young college women to daily polish our lanterns of 
testimony.  She wanted us to keep them shining brightly.  We experimented 
upon her words and found her counsel to be good and true.  Her name was 
Lola Sedgewick.  She was the the fine mother of Lolly Sedgewick.  Lolly 
Sedgewick is now the fine wife of a General Auxiliary Leader, Elder Russell 
Osguthorpe.  I love Light!  Sincerely!  Christine Delight...﻿
