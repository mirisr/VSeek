Beautiful heart warming video, thank youï»¿I literary cried! And im only 13, this was the exact video that I needed 
for my FHE lesson about service!!!I love (t)HIS church!!!Service is awesome!I have watched this over and over again and am moved. My parents and I were 
in a similar situation 5 years ago. The roof on our generational home caved 
in and and the ceilings and insulation were covering our possessions. My 
father felt hopeless and broken. Within a couple hours, nearly all the 
priesthood in our ward were at our home bagging our possessions. My dad's 
testimony and emotion was so sweet. Service is the only way to truly feel 
the Savior so near.I am a member of one of the greatest churches on this earth and I am 
blessed to be able to serve and when in need be served upon. at 2:50 the little girl pushing the broom is great. they are all great. 
1,000s of projects like this every year. People ask us why we do these 
things. The answer is simple and yet profound... because we love them. And 
because He, the Savior, loves us. And gave us life and hope and peace 
through His love and atonement. How I love Him.I love the Church!I like it!Now that's God's love coming through the LDS members.. absolutely 
beautiful! This is how I know this Church is True and the Book of Mormon is 
a true testament of Jesus Christ. God Bless you all!Such a sweet video. We witness of Jesus Christ by the way we live our 
lives, reaching out to help others. Jesus Christ was the Supreme example of 
love and giving.nice!!Do a good turn daily!Awesome. What a sweet old guy...
