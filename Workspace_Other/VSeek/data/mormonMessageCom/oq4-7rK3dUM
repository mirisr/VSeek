"If the bitter cup does not pass, drink it and be strong." Wow... so 
powerful. Thank you!my wife has been a saint suffering with my depression for over a decade! i 
finally got better last year. i don't know excactly how, maybe diet like 
going off gluten Nothing better than listening to conference messages...My wife suffers from major depression. We both know it not to be easy, but 
we know it will be worth it. One small step at a time. Mosiah 4:27 And see 
that all these things are done in wisdom and aorder; for it is not 
requisite that a man should run bfaster than he has strength. And again, it 
is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the 
prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.Touched me deeply. One of the post powerful messages I have ever heard.
