The Lord gives the things often by our feelings!! He may speak to you at 
English Did Jesus speak english?Someone once said that we have been rendering unto Caesar that which is 
God's, such as marriage, and I would add the raising of our children. I 
love this video! Christ teaches that we are to obey true authority.What a beautiful video :) Thank you Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Sainits These Bible series are wonderful !! Very Good and very inspring and very 
well done. Jesus our lord right when he finishes i just want to yell "OHHHH, He told you!!!"Jesus Christ is wise.But what did Jesus mean by his ambiguous words. What is Caesar's and what 
is God's? The riddle is easily solved by those who know Scripture, and 
Jesus knew Scripture better than anyone before or since. At the age of 12 
he was opening up its veiled meanings to the priests in the Temple at 
Jerusalem. (Luke 2:39-52) And Scripture makes Jesus' words clear and 
unambiguous. Psalm 24:1 is most explicity: "The earth is the Lord's and 
everything it it," which obviously leaves nothing for poor old Caesar.Great videosWhile we are on the earth we are not expected to sit idly by while our 
brothers and sisters need our help. There is much good that we can do here. 
Civil governments exist for the benefit of mankind and work best when 
founded on the principles of the Gospel. Inasmuch as men obey the laws of 
God, it is good to have rulers, since they can promote righteous practices. 
When the leaders dishonor God, we ought to seek change according to the 
law, with love, patience and pure knowledge.
