This is wonderful!﻿Inspirational T_T, here I am with both feet in tact and I'm still 
complaining about what I don't have....there she is, happy...even if she 
only had prosthetic legs...﻿I have nothing to complain about after watching this. What a great message!﻿"¡Me impacto mucho ver este Video aqui tengo una silla de ruedas y 
preguntare en mi comunidad quien lo nesecita..?..!"﻿Imagine if a back in ancient times she had been run over by a cart. She is 
very blessed. My well wishes go out to you.﻿Amazing﻿Isn't science incredible?﻿What a touching video! I'm so glad the church can help people in need. :)﻿Awsome﻿What an amazing story. It's very moving to think of how many of God's 
children are in need and in how many ways.﻿Fantastic video. It doesn't matter what you believe. Helping others is 
always awesome. Thanks Mormon Channel.﻿
