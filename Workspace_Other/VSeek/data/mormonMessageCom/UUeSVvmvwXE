I love being Mormon. It is the greatest thing ever.A wonderful lesson on faith can be read in The Book of Mormon. Alma 
32.There are also other chapters about faith, hope and charity. There are 
also cross references to verses to the Holy Bible. im proud to be a member of this church...Though i am not a follower of this Church, but i love these videos, i could 
listen day and night. So beautiful, God Bless. Would be nice if you could 
please post more videos on Faith. Explaining to everyone the meaning of 
Faith, how it feels, why we must have it, what is like. People must 
understand that Faith should be like THE FAITH JESUS HAD...going to Church, 
reading the Bible or believing in Jesus is not enough. Videos on Faith 
inspired me to wanna have Faith, and many are in need of it tooi love these messages from the prophet and others..what strengthquisiera que lo que me mandan lo hicieran en espa√±ol se lo agradezco I Love This Man Of God.necesito ver el video de la conferencia en espamnos,que hago?
