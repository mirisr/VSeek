Music was~sorry, I meant IS~Created by God﻿Beautiful﻿I really needed this .......thank you Men of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir﻿Great stuff.  Dang, was that a high B at the end that the tenors were 
singing?﻿This one of my favorite songs of praise.﻿this is on my bucket list to see this choir.﻿The only time in all the gospels that Jesus Christ prays to God and doesn’t 
call Him Father is on the cross.  What He loses, we gain﻿So heavenly!﻿I agree with comments already made... that if you need a strengthening of 
your belief in the good that you can do.  It's worth a listen now and 
again.  Heavenly Father does not want to lose one of his precious souls but 
he gives us the opportunity to figure out how to return to him.  This is a 
way for me to get grounded in the things that are important.﻿Bonita cancion﻿Thank you verymuch for all these wonderful love songs of which im searchin 
for so long......they are my favorites....﻿This is how "Men of God " are  to be Praising GOD  Halleluiah!﻿This raises me up as no music can.﻿If you need peace and calmness in your life at this time...STOP and listen 
to this beautiful song. It instantly lifts  the frustration, lonliness and 
hopelessness from your soul and replaces it with peace and hope.﻿Amazing!﻿Superstars!!!!!﻿I saw them perform a few years ago. They are so good.﻿Por ti seré,lo mejor para VIVIR !!!  _()_  ♥﻿In the many overpowering experiences of my life, there is the Father of 
Creation and He make me equal to what it is I am passing through AND the 
strength to go on with my life. He has never let me down or not been there. 
And holy thankfulness, this is true for all his children.﻿amazing..Praise the lord..﻿MAN!! That's good stuff!!!﻿The true picture of perfection in this world!﻿You Raise Me Up
(祢鼓舞了我)

When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;
當我失落的時候，噢，我的靈魂，感到多麼的疲倦；
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;
當有困難時，我的心背負著重擔，
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
然後，我會在寂靜中等待，
Until you come and sit awhile with me. 
直到祢的到來，並與我小坐片刻。

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
祢鼓舞了我，所以我能站在群山頂端；
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
祢鼓舞了我，讓我能走過狂風暴雨的海；
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
當我靠在祢的肩上時，我是堅強的；
You raise me up... To more than I can be.
祢鼓舞了我...讓我能超越自己。

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
祢鼓舞了我，所以我能站在群山頂端；
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
祢鼓舞了我，讓我能走過狂風暴雨的海；
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
當我靠在祢的肩上時，我是堅強的；
You raise me up... To more than I can be.
祢鼓舞了我...讓我能超越自己。

There is no life -- no life without its hunger;
沒有一個生命 -- 沒有生命是沒有渴求的；
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;
繹動的心不安地跳動著；
But when you come and I am filled with wonder,
但是當祢來臨的時候，我充滿了驚喜，
Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity. 
有時候，我覺得我看到了永恆。

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
祢鼓舞了我，所以我能站在群山頂端；
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
祢鼓舞了我，讓我能走過狂風暴雨的海；
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
當我靠在祢的肩上時，我是堅強的；
You raise me up... To more than I can be.
祢鼓舞了我...讓我能超越自己。

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;

當我靠在祢的肩上時，我是堅強的；
You raise me up... To more than I can be.
祢鼓舞了我...讓我能超越自己。

onnipotente Dio.So beautifullI listen weekly to this wonderful performanceNice....Ryan Murphy How can people dislike this, it is beautiful!the best thing ever happened love them love this song in total love it. 
rating 10:10God,thank you give us peace and loveThank you for your humanitarian efforts with the people of Fukushima. What 
a devastating event for them...for the world.It would've been pretty cool if this had been the grand finale to "The Book 
of Mormon" (the play). A nice little curve ball.Of course you belong here. God wants all of His children to feel His peace 
and His love. Thank you for sharing your heartfelt thoughts.amazing ...God Bless you allJesus Bless you all......Beautiful........... Beautiful, what a blessingI’m not quite sure how I arrived at this video, but I am most glad I did. 
This is beautiful and, for a brief moment at least, I feel warmth, and at 
peace. I know I don’t belong here… but thank you for sharing.I listened to this recording in April 2011, in a truck driving from Sendai 
to Fukushima, a few days after the great earthquake and tsunami in Japan. 
My wife and I were doing humanitarian relief for the LDS Church. After 
seeing the devastation left by this disaster, this hymn brought tears to my 
eyes as I knew that only God could really help those people arise from the 
devastation we had seen, but that it was our mission to do everything in 
our power to assist the Lord in that process.I' am very happy you Love The Choir. Thank You! I Love The Choir As Well. 
And I' am Mormon.I already knew that since I am Mormon too.It is always nice to be reminded 
about this part of the Gospel.Very confident conductor. He makes the singers and orchestra to sing and 
play very smooth and secure. He has a different style than others 
conductors from MTC but is very good and enjoyable. By the way, what is his 
name? Awesome! I selected this song for my father's funeral service in honor of 
how he helped his family our entire lives. Thanks to the choir for singing 
such a beautiful song in so powerful a way.great and wonderful song, very impressive. I liked the way that this conductor lead the choir and orchestra. What is 
his name?Wonderful and powerful message, message of trust and rest in God. A hymn to 
meditate in the words. A true message magnificent song Are you talking about Romeo X Juliet???He is in the Celestial kingdom! He wasn't past the age of eight.. I can 
guarantee you that!one of my favorite songs ever I like this song very well!Thanks or the inspiration. I wish he whole worrld could hear you fellas 
praise God in song. Back in July of 2011 my great nephew died in an drowning accident he was 
only 5years old.This song was sung at his memorial service.God needed 
another angel at that time.Amazing, just amazingone thing................. awesome It's sort of surreal hearing the Tabernacle Choir sing a song that I first 
heard from an anime. O_oawesomei was there and i couldnt stop crying what a magnificent show of the amazing feats we can over come with the 
gospel in our lives the amazing things we are able to do thanks to heavenly
