I do not understand why somebody would not like this awesome video. I love 
elder Ballard.﻿What this Apostle has said in this address is all true!  I have lived this 
man's counsels and he is right. Please, follow him! He is a true messenger 
of the Lord Jesus Christ and God Our Heavenly Father!  I love you all, my 
brothers and sisters. It won't be easy but well worth it!﻿There is great wisdom here. I would add that being still is nt about having 
the external world be quiet.. that limits your opportunities cause its 
noisy  most the time ..the real power is to find distance from your 
thoughts .The real noise of the world is the noise of your mind..that too 
will be noisy most the time cause its a thinking machine thats its job...so 
the secret is to become the observer..to find distance between u and your 
thoughts.We are not our thoughts or feelings or any other external thing of 
form... the real you is what is aware of these things...thats what 
awareness is all about. .You can practice this 24/7 if u want til one day u 
can be in peak hour traffic and you have attuned to the peace that is 
noticing the thoughts feelings and sensation arising.You have dis 
identified with the stressful thoughts...u have found some distance from 
them and are no longer them.This is freedom,this is peace and u need not go 
to a mountin top to do it. Peace love and goodness to all.﻿
