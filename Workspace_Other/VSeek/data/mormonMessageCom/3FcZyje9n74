Austin thank you for sharing your story. It has helped me on my road of 
recovery.﻿That seems like some plot out of a movie...Incredible! Jesus is Our 
Redeemer and He alone changes us to be His children.
I agree with spank---I Love the gospel! I also agree that the recovery 
classes are like nothing else I've ever experienced. It's like the room 
gets warmer and brighter when the group begins. So much love and healing!﻿THis when you or he was inactive and then came back to church right?﻿Every descriptive word he shared about how it feels to walk into a group 
meeting is 100% true. It is the most loving and understanding atmosphere I 
know on planet Earth! :)﻿AUSTIN... Are you kidding me?!? I had no idea. Your story is intense I am 
so glad the cartel never found you or hurt you. You and your wonderful wife 
have served and help change the lives of so many people in the program.
With God you are one of the strongest soldiers in his army. Thank you for 
always fighting, suiting up and showing up.﻿
