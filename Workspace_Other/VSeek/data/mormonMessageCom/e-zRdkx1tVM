Our baby boy is 6 and a half months old now. My wife became pregnant the 
month she stopped taking birth control, which was only in the second month 
of our marriage. It just felt right to start our family growing. Already 
working on his second tooth!I believe the fun that comes out of that is the responses they get once 
they say first. I'd say its just another way to troll. Ignore them.My wife and I have been married fr almost 3 years now (this coming April 6) 
and we still don't have a baby of our own. It makes us feel sad sometimes.. 
but yeah we trust the Lord for His timing and will.THERE ARE SOME THAT KNOW THE TRICK TO MAKE only one Seriously, why will anyone feel the need to say that?im getting to this point in my life too! (O_O) its so hard to believe i 
remember like it was yesterday, being 12 years old thinking, i wish i could 
be 18 that life seems so meaningful and free, now im 20 give me 5 or 10 
years and for sure ill have atleast 1 kid (O_O) and ill be a father, this 
is what it all comes down to
