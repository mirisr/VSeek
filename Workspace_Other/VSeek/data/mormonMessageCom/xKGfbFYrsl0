Testify of Christ my manï»¿Im not diabetic, but I have other problems that worry me. This was a good 
reminder, one that I neededwhere can I get insturmental music for videos we are making a video of 
testimonies for the missionaries to help get some members back to church 
any help would be great. ThanksI had a diabetic companion on my mission. He was and is a great servant of 
the Lord. Way to go Brothere:-)@paqman87 it's made by random members of the Church, not video experts, so 
that explains some of the weird audio@srduncanbyu i know, mormon messages needed to change the 
soundtrack..anyways you can watch the original mormon message on my 
channel. :)my nephew is also a diabetic - thanks for a video I can share with him to 
help him when he considers going on a missionsei uno grande Anziano! forza forza! not a big fan of the music
