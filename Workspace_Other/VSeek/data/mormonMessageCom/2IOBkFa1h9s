As long as you keep reaching up to the Lord to lift you out, there will 
never be one too many times you can fall.But with the Lord's help you can use The Lords paint thinner and try again. 
That is the beauty of repentance and forgiveness, and redeeming grace of 
our Savior. Our Heavenly Father loves us and will always provide a way for 
us to come back to Him if we so choose. <3 :-) What a wonderful talk!i want to keep progressing by using my moral agency correctly! i know the 
lord will help me with that!I have painted myself in a corner, one too many times.
