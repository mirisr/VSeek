I love the the Gospel of Jesus Christ.﻿Song name?﻿I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!!!
﻿I love this when I wasn't sure if God was real I asked my brother that is a 
missionary and he sent me this video﻿Yes. You don't need big angelic manifestations. You only need small 
experiences. For by small and simple things are great things brought to 
pass.﻿God Is Love. He is So Merciful, and wants us to choose to be humble, to 
choose to pray, this is how we exercise faith. How grateful I am for the 
many, many times He has lifted me out of despair, out of misery, and out of 
sin. How grateful I am for the Book of Mormon. That Book of Books will, 
when daily study and ponder of it, will bring the Spirit into our lives. 
It's Great! He Lives.﻿I love this video. there is hope for me. Thank you﻿I love this video﻿I'm a member. and currently in the process of going on a mission. but I'm 
struggling with past issues that have developed over time and have become 
habits. I fight everyday and yet I still seem to fail. Even after 
confessing to my bishop and even visiting a counselor.. I've read my 
scriptures quite often and I have prayed numerous times. But seldom do I 
feel the warm hug when I pray. I watch these videos and I envy other 
individuals who have had their spiritual awakening or their expression of 
love. I only wish I knew how to progress from my stand still..﻿I love this video. Xxx﻿I love this video. Not a Mormon too, but nearly joined. The video is 
amazing xx﻿I love this video. Not a Mormon too, but nearly joined. The video is

fasting and praying to god, at first he did really have faith about fasting 
and praying but then god actually answered his prayers, and as he said he 
finally found a place he felt comfortable and the holy spirit with him. He 
found happiness for the first time.﻿This video of a man who did drugs and drank alcohol life changed just by

cried when I saw this, it may change you life just like this mans life did.﻿Such a powerful message. Thank God for his unmerited favor!﻿Gostei muito do canal um dia espero frequentar a igreja em Provo!!﻿I have been pondering the church for a year or so now and I am just now 
becoming active. I have been meeting with missionaries and they told me to 
watch this video, and it brought me to tears. They insist it was the holy 
ghost but I still dont think I know what it was. I love this video.﻿Hi, everyone forgive my profile picture, but I have a 17 year old sister 
who has lost her  way (she is a straight A student doesn't drink or do 
drugs!) and this video gave me a strong feeling that I should show this to 
her and although she did not want to watch it at first I am not going to 
give up because as an 11 year old I know I can't do much, in fact and can't 
even pass the sacrament yet but i'm going to keep trying because it would 
mean so much for my family to get sealed in the temple together and also I 
just love this video.﻿amen and hallelujah hallelujah ﻿Wonderful testimony.. Im not a Mormon but I pray through Jesus that many 
more find HIM x﻿I am neither religious nor Christian but that does not matter. It 
penetrates the heart and reaches far beyond the heart--may be my Soul.﻿Such a powerful video. God does really does love everyone.﻿As a convert I see so much of my own journey in this video... i just saw 
this last general conference and I just started crying cause the only 
difference between this guy and me was that I played football/soccer... it 
was a real experience to see such an accurate depiction of my own 
conversion!﻿Thanks. It was helpful. God,hope and trust to him.﻿i need this video I'm mormon sometimes i make bad choices and don't know if 
god is there still willing to forgive me﻿The struggles that every man, woman and child must endure are known by the 
Savior of all mankind and He is here to help you overcome them. It does 
require you, me and all of us to act, to try our faith and He will show 
Himself. Have you seen God in your life?﻿Such a great story provided with stunning and unique visuals to help 
further tell the story. Love it ﻿It made me goosebumps.﻿so beautiful😅😅😅😅😍﻿This video do help me so much. I thought I was alone with problems (attempt 
suicides and been waiting hear from God for so long). I start to gave up on 
the church when I believe that there is no God. But with this video, Todd 
remind me about God do answer my praying in other ways such in small 
methods. Also, Todd's story helped me to remember my journey to joined 
church and my struggling to find Him. (I am still struggle though!!) I'm 
thankful for this video's powerful message and remind me that I'm not 
alone.﻿faith is through the light of Christ﻿God is real, he answers our prayers.  He will help us through troubled 
times.  I love my Heavenly Father and I know that he loves me and will not 
leave me.  I also know that I must invite him.﻿Was this filmed at the Spiral Jetty?﻿Amen﻿By far my favorite Mormon message. Not only does it have a beautiful 
message, the videography is insane. Love love love.﻿Not Mormon (almost was), but when I was investigating the church I was 
shown this video by missionaries and sobbed. I have so much love for your 
church and its teachings although I didn't join for reasons I won't go in 
to. As someone who suffers with depression, this video means a lot to me. 
Our Heavenly Father, who created the entire, beautiful Universe, cares so 
much about each and everyone one of us, despite how small and lost we feel 
sometimes. Our Redeemer lives.﻿Does anyone know who the director of this video was ? ﻿Blessed ﻿Well produced video. I loved the voice and the interpretation of the actor. 
The landscape comparing with his lonely and troubled life is amazing.  ﻿Wow! I'm not a Mormon,  but you guys can make some killer video's. #PTL﻿God need's us on his side.......﻿if you have eyes to see and a mind to think why haven't you deciphered your 
very existence?
if you ARE how can you NOT? prepare for an eternal afterlife, not an 
eternal reincarnation, now is the time, earth is the melting pot of 
decisive critical choice's
there IS a way to escape your cursed fate... the perfect BLOOD OF JESUS 
CHRIST revealed to us surely but slowly since the time of corruption, 
ACKNOWLEDGE, seek FORGIVENESS, REPENT, and wash in the blood of Jesus 
Christ, of the HOLY TRINITY which make up a singularity, don't let the 
black hole drag you to outer darkness﻿Truly beautiful!﻿Please someone prove it to me. Do mormons read the bible or a different 
book?﻿Amazing! ;)﻿He knows our name and he loves us even when the world has abandoned us in 
our hour of need . God our Father will not abandon us or forsake us Jesus 
is faithful to his promises and he is the Word of God so you know you can 
trust Him. ﻿speechless﻿dayne rockwood he served in my ward . love this message ﻿I like this video,it make me fell the love of God. I know that  God loves 
us and He answers our prayers at his time.
Lo sé.﻿I like the story, but If Heavenly Father informed Todd's friend the next 
day or week instead of a month, then I believe more atheists would convert.

Heavenly Father does this to challenge people's faith. ﻿
