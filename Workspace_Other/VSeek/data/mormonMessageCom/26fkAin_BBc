awesome message!﻿We all need to understand the absolute importance of family. Without Godly 
families, societies fall apart.﻿Dad does it best lol﻿This message was SO cute﻿I absolutley adored the "Family isn't it about time" commercials growing 
up. Love the new family ones as well. Very sweet and uplifting.﻿I love that he was willing to still make the salsa. It reminds me of every 
time my husband tries to talk me through a minor car repair. He was a good 
sport about it. ﻿Most well behaved kids ever﻿Love this!﻿Ahhh, the kids are so cute. :)﻿This is when I tell my husband to go by salsa. Sheesh. :)﻿Amen to that!﻿I like this one. :) cute, very true, and loving. Well done. ♡﻿#MormanChannel Did an apostle pass away ? I'm a ten year old that goes to 
the Pionner Park Ward . I'm exicted that I joined the Church Of Jesus 
Christ of Ladder-Day Saints! I joined last year !! :) ﻿Thanks for the video! God bless! 😃﻿Take the boys go to the market by the salsa., come home and enjoy the 
family together . children are gods special gift to us and they are only 
children once.﻿❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻﻿That is so sad ﻿
