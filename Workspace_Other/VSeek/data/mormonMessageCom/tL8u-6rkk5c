What a BEAUTIFUL family.﻿+AsKaGangsta everything is a choice. it is your choice to go on a mission 
if you join our church. no obligation﻿This is a great familly Trevor was one of my mission companions!!﻿adoption is amazing there are already so many children already here that 
need loving parents and if you can afford it or cnt have children yourself 
its a great thing to give that child a good life I plan to adopt one day if 
i can afford it whether i can have my own or not﻿family is more than blood(or bloodlines). meaning anyone can be family, its 
just your look on it!﻿this is an amazing video﻿Should I become a mormon﻿I love this!!!﻿Thank you Mormon Channel for this video! There are so many great families 
out there in this world. I have a small family, my husband and I have only 
one child together but we are happy and we love, laugh and cry our way 
through life...we know through Gospel Principles that families are 
forever!!﻿Nothing more important on this earth than families. Together we can all 
make it back to live with our Heavenly Father and there be together forever 
as families. ﻿Me facinan los videos﻿Yay for Families. Got to love them.﻿
