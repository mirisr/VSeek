Nephi and his brothers are sent back a second time. this time they have to 
ask Ishmael of the tribe of Manasseh if they can marry one of his daughters 
also they need to bring him with them to Father Lehi since he is a prophet. 
the sons of Lehi succeed and bring Ishmael out but they run into problems 
Laman and Lemuel rebel and tie Nephi up he breaks the ropes and returns to 
camp.﻿my favorite part is when The Lord leaves the Liahona on Father Lehi's 
doorstep this little compass will help them get to America. later Nephi 
used it when they ran into problems when his bow broke. so he made a new 
one and used the Liahona to find his game then he brought them back for 
them to eat.﻿These are great
