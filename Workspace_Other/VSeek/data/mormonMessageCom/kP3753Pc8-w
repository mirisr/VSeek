This is my life experience; Secrets of Heaven and miracles are in front of 
our eyes everyday. we just have to pay attention and we will see them.﻿Thank you Jesus, for your Love, for haven thought us all that your father 
our Lord thought you, and asking us to go to the world to make disciples of 
your Gospel
Lord Jesus This day please give me grace and wisdom to take your people 
through these moments where we prepare for your final coming﻿Jesus must have been so happy at this time and relieved to have his 
suffering over with, having suffered the Atonement and the cross.  I am 
happy for him.﻿Thank you. This is a beautiful video.﻿
