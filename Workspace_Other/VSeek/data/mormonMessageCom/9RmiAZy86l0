President Heaton! that's my stake president.﻿"The priorities and interests we most often see on display around us (and 
sometimes in us) are intensely selfish: a hunger to be recognized; the 
insistent demand that one’s rights be respected (including a supposed right 
never to be offended);"
This is a new and beautiful thought for me.﻿
