I love how little children in these videos say things that leave their 
parents speechless. It reminds me of this scripture, in Alma 32:23 "And 
now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women 
also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them 
many times, which confound the wise and the learned."ï»¿So simple, yet so effective! :')love it it made me cry Great videoAn Excellent Video!"Couldn't do better" :)
