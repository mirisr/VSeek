Thank you, Elder Nelson. I'm a child of God.ï»¿He is a remarkable man. I had the privelege of working with Dr. Nelson in 
the Open heart room at LDS Hospital and as a new Grad I was very nervous. 
But through workiing with Dr. Nelson, I learned and gained confidence that 
sustained me throughout my 30 year career as a Registered Nurse. He is a 
very powerful and blessed force for our Church. The keys belong to Peter, not Joseph Smith.
