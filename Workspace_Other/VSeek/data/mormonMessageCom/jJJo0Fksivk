towards His Mother the combination of my knowledge that Jesus is my Savior 
and the Savior of the whole world and the camera angle and the glorious 
song brings the spirit n the spirit deeply touches my heart. Im so 
greatfull for my Savior. What is the name of that song ??? I really want to

empty life <3 Thank you so much because you loved me <3﻿Thank you Lord that you have saved me; Thank you that you have healed me ; 
Thank you that you prospered me because of True Love <3 ﻿That was a great story. Whoever played Young Jesus in this video did it 
will.﻿All these  years  The Gospel  still spreads .. i  need  say no more ,God 
bless  you all  whom see this  video  but see  not Jesus  in the flesh  but 
still believe.﻿In the light of Col 3:1-, "If then you were raised with Christ, seek those 
things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. 
Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth. For you died, 
and your life has been hidden with Christ in God."
In whose 'business' is one considering, Joh 8:44-, "You are of your father 
the devil, and the lusts of your father you desire to do," whenever one 
finds delight in 'the things of the world'?﻿Great movie clip art on Boy Jesus in the Temple.﻿
