I want God in my life.﻿Jesus is Lord﻿Elder Oaks outlines practical ramifications and opportunities to share and 
build the Kingdom of God in our day and times. As we internalize and act on 
his counsel, we can have increased hope that "even though the world worsens 
around us," with divine intervention, we can join hands with "many, many 
fine and wonderful men and women of all races and creeds—and of no 
religious creeds at all—who will continue to lead decent and useful lives." 
(Elder Maxwell, April 1988 Conference) We can; we will.Face your fears, and you'll find courage.A speech against political correction. I like it!!! Best full encompassing talk everAlimentarse con buena comida espiritual es delicioso a nuestro espiritu. 
Disfrutenlo.One of the greatest talks ever. The world needs to hear and follow this 
message.I always love to hear Elder Oaks. He has a very logical, practical mind and 
he sets eternal principles out in such a way as to be understandable. Here 
he answers those who feel LDS are biased, racist etc. because we insist 
that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Any other kind of 
marriage is non-productive. Elder Oaks reminds us that Heavenly Father 
always and only wants what is best for his children and that is the why of 
the Laws of God and Heaven.Amazing!! Have 20 kids! Ready Go! You will be blessed abundantly!
