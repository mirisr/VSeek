A Makita grinder would be a great tool to smooth the welds. What is this 
man's address?﻿Good job. Keep it up!﻿This is such a cool video about a guy who made his own wheelchair.  Must 
see!﻿It's so inspiring to see the positive affect that wheelchair has on his 
life!﻿Inspiring message! Service to others does bring a big smiling face!﻿Quality! He's managed to help himself, plus he now has the skills to pay 
the bills!﻿Awesome. :-)
