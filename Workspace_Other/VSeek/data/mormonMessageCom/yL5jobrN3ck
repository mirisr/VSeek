Love the music.Personally, I liked it better without the music. But hey, beggars can't be 
choosers, and I'm really begging for more videos like this one. We need 
them and things like them so much. wow.. beautiful :) The first time I watched this a while back there was no music, just 
crickets chirping and thei apostles' footsteps in the grass. The scene 
seemed much more realistic that way, I liked it better. Still an awesome 
video though.As I listened, I wished so deeply that Jesus would also pray for me even as 
He had for His.disciples. Then I realized that He had...I love Him so. I 
wish I could be perfect for Him..I feel like Simon...Beautiful :)These videos remind me that all the time, even dark circumstances as this, 
that Jesus was always teaching, instructing and strengthening his apostles. 
He truly gave all of himself to us and to everyone around him....First!
