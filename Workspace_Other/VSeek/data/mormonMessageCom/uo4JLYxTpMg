I love the violins playing the opening strains!! I feel like just swaying 
along to it every time that I hear this hauntingly beautiful hymn performed 
by the Tabernacle Choir! One of my most favorite and beloved Christmas 
songs! Keep the angelic music coming Tabernacle Choir!﻿just a beautiful piece,,,﻿Just so beautiful...beautiful piece, beautifully rendered.﻿the voices of angels from heaven﻿So peaceful and beautiful!﻿Incredibly beautiful. Wow!﻿I love this song!!﻿has anyone ever noticed how this choir uses no vibrato. In my opinion, 
vibrato has little use in group singing. I think i have discovered one of 
the reasons this choir sounds so angelic. This carol is also my favorite 
that MTC performs.﻿
