If only these opportunities were available for Investigators who are not 
allowed to be baptized because of familial reasonsI know these great couples, know their hearts, and know there honesty. I 
have attended a session as well, and know of the power and healing that can 
come from being honest about our problems. It's great to see friends from the Naperville 3rd ward. I wish you both the 
best on your mission.This video is wonderful! I hope and pray that many who see it will desire 
to serve as Missionary Group leaders in the LDS Addiction recovery program. 
My husband and I served in this wonderful program for 3 years, and loved 
every minute of it. We only stopped serving when we felt that there was 
something else that the Lord had wanted us to do, and we found that out 
only months later, when my husband was called to be the bishop of our ward. 
The Lord needs our service everywhere!I totally agree! I too began as one in recovery, facilitated for a few 
years and continue to be a huge advocate.This is wonderful! I served in the LDS FS ARP for several years and 
continue to advocate for it!Great missionaries doing a wonderful service for others in need. Awesome!Having been involved in this program as an attendee and facilitator I can 
say that it truly changed my life. If you have an addiction of any kind 
this program can help you, and I urge you to go. So Awesome :)
