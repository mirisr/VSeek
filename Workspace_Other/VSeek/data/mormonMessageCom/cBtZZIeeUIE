It would have been even more amazing if they got to go inside. ï»¿Yes, temples can be buildings. We need a place to perform ordinences- 
somewhere holy and away from the world. Christ said that, yes, but he 
walked through temples, didn't he?one issue is that Christ said,,,That his body is the temple.....Now some 
say self....others say Christ ether way....A true temple is not a 
building.....Apparently someone forgot to tell these young people!!! talk 
about temptation being all around thee!I love that the young women wore modest clothing for the hike!I loved loved lover this!!I really enjoyed this, and as long as we can see the TEMPLE you're never 
lost!:)Loved this video! The blessings of the Temple are amazing!beautiful story!!
