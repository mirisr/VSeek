my brethran and sisters enjoy the lds music i say this because im an active 
member of the church﻿It is good to see so many of Heavenly Father's sons and daughters prepared 
to take the glorious message or the gospel to the rest of their brothers 
and sisters.  Praise to the man through who the Father restored such great 
knowledge and joy.  Glory, laud, and honor to our Father forever and 
forever amen.﻿Amen﻿Amen﻿Amen!﻿I love that man.﻿David Archuleta happened to be on the front row at 4:43. Who would have 
thought? Very well done!﻿Only quibble on this arrangement is that on the last verse they do not hit 
the high E. But the final verse, when the volume is the loudest, is when 
that note would pack more of a punch. (example of the note: "mingling with 
Gods he can plan FOR his brethren") Usually on arrangements like this, you 
want those big notes for the finale.You're right. #MoTab stands for Mormon Tabernacle ChoirThis may or may not be a common misconception... MTC does not stand for 
Mormon Tabernacle Choir, It stands for Missionary Training Center.Wonderfully performed, Angels sent from heaven. May God bless them as the 
spread the Great news of the Restoration of the Gospel across this Earth to 
once more return to live with our Heavenly Father again. Thank you!wow i really need learn how to play the organ! (thats my dream job play
