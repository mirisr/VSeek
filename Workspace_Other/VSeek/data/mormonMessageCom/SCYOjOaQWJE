Probably my favorite talk from the conference. Great message, our Savior 
Jesus Christ will always be there to administer the healing for us. Also 
the accent rocks. Every time I listen to this I feel peace again.patrick kearon is a legend ive known him since i was a girl he is an 
amazing man so is his wife. sorry this is dc's sister.lolI really enjoyed this message. One of my favorites of the conference.one of the best talks during the entire conference! and his accent rocks! :)"No one can find peace in"a mine field."This reminded me of a talk from the 80's about an indian boy who let 
himself be talked into carrying a snake from the top of a mountain down to 
the floor. The snake told him that he would not bite him but that he would 
treat him different. When he got to the bottom and gently laid the snake 
down it bit him which he died from. Before he died the snake responded to 
his protest that they had a deal with "You knew what I was when you picked 
me up". Consequences will always follow eventually.
