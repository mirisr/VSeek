I have so much respect for converts who are willing to push forward with 
faith like that. My mom had to go through similar experience and I am so 
grateful she did or else I would not be where I am today. ﻿Great message about how everyone needs love and support.﻿What an adorable girl.﻿It's great to hear..﻿This is perfect. <3﻿Depression brought on by loss of family﻿"When I chose to love them unconditionally, I was able to understand them 
about their concerns of me, and was able to forgive them more easily." Not 
her exact words, but this is what happens when we live a Christ-Like life, 
we do and say like He would, and my goodness is it peaceful/comforting. 
Thank you, Lexie!﻿Awesome video about the pain a convert can go through without their 
family's support. I love her outlook!﻿
