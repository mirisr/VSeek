Where are all the people in the background walking to?  I would be 
mesmerized in my chair if I was there watching this.﻿Fine singing !﻿LOVE IT!﻿Original German﻿Actually they still do, though more commonly for the women's choir I think. 
I remember singing this back in middle school myself around 2004 or so. And 
then we were given the treat of having both the men and women's groups sing 
all of Vivaldi's Gloria. A bit long, but it was a lot of fun to sing such 
great music with an actual orchestra :) They did try to have us sing some 
show tunes, but we didn't perform those as well as the old hymns, etc. Show 
tunes were kind of annoying to sing really :(This song blesses me so much, Praise to the Lord the AlmightyI remember being in the 8th grade choir at Coontz Jr. High in Bremerton, WA 
in 1956 and singing this song. I'll bet you won't find it at any public 
school these days. How we have strayed from the principles that built this 
mighty nation and left us in the chaos of today.REally enjoyed this heartfelt singing! Praise Him indeed.As an Episcopalian, who sang this while processing in yesterday morning, it 
was a joy to watch my Mormon brothers praise our Lord today!Oh how i am blessed to be a member of The church of the latter day saints 
because of how much peace and comfort thy God has given me and now that i 
have him i know i am not alone :)I am an ELCA Lutheran from South Carolina. I play the piano and organ. 
Today (June 2, Pentecost 2), we sang this as the Opening Hymn. It is #858 
in Evangelical Lutheran Worship.wondeful
