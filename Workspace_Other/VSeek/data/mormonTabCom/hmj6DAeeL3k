what a wonderful choir. alot people but one sound of peace﻿Beautiful music. Our choir is singing it at our Stake Conference next month 
and I hope we will sound almost as good as the Tabernacle Choir.﻿Wonderful song, many thanks for listing it.﻿the music is beautiful... the words r true inspiration... it has been 
suggested that we the Boston Massachusetts Stake Relief Society of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints use this theme..."take time to 
be holy" as our 2015 theme... as the rs pres of the Worcester 1st Ward 
Boston Stake i give my whole heart approval... i think the whole church 
shud use this theme for 2015...take a few mins and read the lyrics to this 
inspirational hymn...simple truth that will increase anyone's capacity to 
love their fellow man as the Savior has taught us through His perfect 
example...thk u for sharing this with me!﻿
