This was so very fun.  We actually had the option to conduct the choir (by 
green screen and video) which was really great for a conductors conference. 
 This was a winning idea and the staff that took care of the booth were 
very kind and helpful.  Thank you so much - from a grateful participant﻿Would this count if we could do this and then say we sang with thee MoTab 
Choir and Orchestra? My daughter, who is about to celebrate her 4th 
anniversary with thee Choir on this upcoming Mother's Day, said that the 
choir allows family members to sing with the Choir (rehearsal only) on 
their 80th birthday. I better start working out, eating right, and getting 
enough rest. I will be there. Henry Van Dyke said, “Use what talents you 
possess; the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those 
that sang best.”﻿That's a fun idea.  The "guest singers" looked like they enjoyed themselves 
:)﻿
