Thanks very much for posting.Beautiful! This hymn needs to be in the LDS hymnal!Thank you, Ryan, for this beautiful arrangement of what was my 
grandfather's favorite hymn.Ahh one of my favorite song...the choir is amazing in this rendtion and the 
orchestra accompaniment is so lovely beyond words. Kudos to Mr Murphy for 
this arrangement.heard this at a district conference in Southampton while a missionary. A 
nice lady sang it and I loved it. It's not in the LDS songbook but it 
should be. lindo por demais. amei.My mother and father used to sing that song as a duet in sacrament meetings 
and when I was a child - the late 1940's and early 1950's. The choir's 
rendition brought back a flood of sacred memories . Thank you
