That is my Favorite Hymn, thank you Bruce R. McConkie﻿You Mormons can sing.
So very beautiful.
xx﻿I believe in Lord Jesus Christ the Son of the Almighty God but not in the 
distorted Joseph Smith church.﻿Just reading the title I feel the holy ghost﻿My favorite hymn in the church. ﻿Among the many hymns and many verses of song, there are a few lines in 
particular that stand out to me. And, perhaps, one in particular; "I 
believe in Christ, so come what may".

As said in D&C 122, verse 7, to Joseph Smith the prophet, by God.
"And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, 
and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; 
if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine 
enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to 
hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open 
the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall 
give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."

Sometimes things seem bleak, perhaps overwhelmingly so. But I believe in 
Christ. So, come what may.﻿Majestuoso, expande el alma de gratitud, alegría, esperanza y paz, mil 
gracias﻿Lego
