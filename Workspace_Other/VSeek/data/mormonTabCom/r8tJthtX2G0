I hate Mormons and religion, but they DO have the best choir. Perfect 
harmonies.﻿We need Louis Armstrong... in this.﻿what a lovely version﻿Beautiful music. How many saints will be in heaven from Mormons? Theology 
is incorrect unfortunately with Joseph Smith. The Book of Mormons is not 
even close to The Holy Bible :)﻿The United States has really abused and destroyed this sacred march with 
jazz....The last country worthy of this song was Rhodesia.﻿so white﻿WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN - MORMON TABLERNACLE CHOIR
