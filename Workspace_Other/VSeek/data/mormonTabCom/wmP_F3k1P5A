Música dos sonhos.﻿As usual, the best!﻿Watching this video again I found very interesting the conductor body 
language from 3:14 to 3:20 specially at the end when he jump up to finalize 
the song. 
As a conductor I am sure that he his enjoying the song. This is what I call 
"put your heart in what you do".﻿What a great song 
It bring joy and happiness.﻿
