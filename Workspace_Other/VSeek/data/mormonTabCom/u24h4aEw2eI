This is IMHO one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded by the MTC. I 
believe there was a prior recording of this piece uploaded with Shane 
Wharmby as soloist a while back. As I recall it was recorded in the 
Convention Center. Not to take away anything from the current soloist in 
this recording, but I think the overall presentation in that recording was 
superior and I wish I could find that video posted here somewhere to add to 
my collection of favorites. If anyone could point me in the right 
direction, I would most appreciate it.

In the meanwhile, I will continue to enjoy this rendition. God bless this 
wonderful choir and the inspiration they bring to music lovers everywhere.﻿"...and make our crossing o'er joyful passing..."  This song speaks such 
peace to anyone who has ever lost a loved one to death.  One of my favorite 
Wilberg originals!﻿Incredible..........just astounding﻿Wow, thank you choir!﻿
