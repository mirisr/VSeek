Beautiful..........really!!!!!!!﻿I love this song! :-)﻿Truly a beautiful hymn and beautifully done by the MTC and orchestra.  I 
love the way they combine music and videos on Music and the Spoken Word.  I 
wish there were more programs like this.﻿Following Music and the Spoken Word on October 6th I began searching 
everywhere for this recording. Thank you for posting! This is amazing. Thank you! Seriously awesome song. Amazing and haunting melody. Ranks right up there
