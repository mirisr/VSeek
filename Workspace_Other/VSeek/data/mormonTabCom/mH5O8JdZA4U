O templo Mormon se transformou em um grande TEATRO musical onde são 
exibidas peças musicais perfeitíssimas. Não existe coral com maior 
perfeição do que os Mormons, mais a grande finalidade que é o louvor a Deus 
deixou de existir.﻿This one is by far my favorite Pioneer Day concert. Great music, great 
guest, great everything!﻿What GLORIOUS music! One concern.  Doesn't Mac Wilberg EVER smile? He is 
always scowling. Is he suffering from terminal seriousness? Apparently he 
never read Spencer Kinard's book, The Worth of a Smile.﻿I honor the Mormon pioneers for their faith, personal and family sacrifice 
their supreme example of courage. Also for having surpassed persecution, 
prejudice and slander of those who do not share their beliefs. This music 
also honors our beloved American nation.﻿What a delightful hour it has been to listen to The Mormon Tabernacle Choir 
and Orchestra from Temple Square with Santino Fontana.  Organist Richard 
Elliott's music as astounding.  Thank you for such a wonderful concert 
right here in my own home.﻿Very boog﻿what a wonderful concert﻿
