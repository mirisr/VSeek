Son maravillosos,DIOS bendiga sus voces gracias.﻿I'm just wondering if anyone has the sheet music for the introduction I 
play the introduction by ear at the moment but I can't work out he bass 
section:/﻿I am an ELCA Lutheran from South Carolina. I play the piano and organ. 
Today (August 9, Pentecost 11), we sang this as our Opening Hymn. It is 
#858 in Evangelical Lutheran Worship.﻿The arrangement, the harmonizing just brings tears everytime i love the 
choir.﻿Teresa Cooper Ward  one year ago asked:
 'Why change the words from the traditional hymn?'
Although the MTC annunciates very well for such a large group, I found 
myself wanting to follow along this morning.  A search of the lyrics raised 
the same question.  Why?  ~SOLI DEO GLORIA~﻿i really like this song it is full of the spirit.Upbeat finally!~!Why change the words from the traditional hymn? Excellent - can't wait to see them again in Salt Lake, and go on the temple 
square tour again :)I could play this all day. How beautiful!Glória a Deus!The harmonizing always amazes me......and I do love me a good choir!This is one of my absolute favorite hyms. I adore MoTab....they are 
spectacular and their phenomenal voices bring the Holy Spirit so 
stongly....Thank you for the awesome upload....God bless you !!
