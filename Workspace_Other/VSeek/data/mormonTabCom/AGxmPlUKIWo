Your percushionest is out standing I love hearing your orchestra. The man 
who is your drum player please give him this message. I love watching him 
so much when the orchestra is on at 9:30 Sunday morning. He stands out when 
he plays his part. My email address is parke.carson@hotmail.com thank you 
so very much Parke CarsonVery interesting. Very cool! Great job. Cool to hear about their experiences. The Orchestra on Temple Square has always been one of my most favorite 
groups to see and hear. The quality is outstanding; I love the expression 
and rich sound. I find it deeply satisfying to experience the wonderful 
variety of music. Thank you for sharing this video with us!Very Happy ;o) Thank you for the great video with all my heart
