She is great and a fantastic performer especially at her age.. I noticed 
she almost has a regular American accent at this point.﻿Dame Angela reading of the christmas story is so epic!﻿Attended the Christmas Concert this past December (2014) featuring Santino 
Fontana and the Sesame Street Muppets. It was the second time I've been to 
the Convention Center, but the first time I was too small to remember. I 
can't tell you the level of excitement I held when I saw the Organs. No 
doubt the best choir in the world.﻿The DVD is out of print and used copies are going at a premium on Amazon.  
Any chance that the MoTab could put the whole thing on Youtube, or even 
sell a download?﻿so...NEED A LITTLE CHRISTMAS doesn't get applause from the LDS crowd? heck, 
it wasn't a Sacrament hymn.﻿Well done.﻿Best Choir in the world by far and I've sung in many around the world!!!!!﻿
