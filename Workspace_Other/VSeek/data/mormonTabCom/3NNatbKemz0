I love hearing hymns at a healthy, invigorating tempo!﻿Loses a bit of its dignity when the tempo is rushed...﻿Ponder anew what the Almighty can do!﻿非常之美妙，好，好。﻿Fine and tuneful, but I prefer a MUCH smaller choir and orchestra 
personally.﻿ou sont les paroles, pourquoi vous perdex votre temps et mon temps 
inutilement﻿TOUJOURS lyrixs svp﻿ou sont les paroles vous chantez pour le monde﻿Lobe den Herrn﻿Great quality, though I feel it is a few bits too fast.﻿Praise to the Lord;
Amazing song to praise the lord of all universe.
Congrats Mack Wilberg for your arrangement  ﻿Possibly my favourite MW arrangement ever (but why choose when you can 
listen to them all!?)﻿Magnificent!﻿My favorite hymn, thank you!﻿I remember visting the tabernacle but i never had the chance to watch a 
live performance. This is great! I hope to see a live performance myself 
one day.﻿
