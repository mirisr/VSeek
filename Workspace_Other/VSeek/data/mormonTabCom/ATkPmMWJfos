Today, a Sunday night, listening this amazing history with the choir in the 
background is a major preparation for one more new week of work and many 
other blessings from God.
This history and the music touched my heart and make realize that God is 
real and an amazing God.
Many of us celebrate  Christmas as a day only to exchange gifts forgetting 
the real meaning of the Christmas.
This song really touched my heart ad tomorrow , Monday  I will still 
enjoying the beauty of this music.
