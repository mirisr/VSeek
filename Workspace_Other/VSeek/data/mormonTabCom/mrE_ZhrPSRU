Jesus Bless You!﻿My new favourite! Where can I purchase the sheet music?﻿This song is so comforting to me﻿How comforting could be a beautiful hymn and a prayer in the herat in a 
cloudy day!﻿All of these people posted beautiful things in what they said.  I will just 
agree with them.﻿this song brought piece into my heart. I know that Savior loves me.﻿Very beautiful just like God is :)﻿I love the gospel, it is another gift the lord has given to his children 
upon the earth. You can really feel the spirit in these songs pertaining to 
the gospel. The gospel belongs to everyone upon the earth. It is amazing 
how much the Lord loves us all.﻿My mind is at peace knowing that if Mack Wilberg died today, the choir 
would safely be in Ryan Murphy's hands. Such beautiful orchestration!﻿Sweet song. 
"I know that my savior loves me" It is a real message from gospel.﻿How fair and lovely is the hope which the Lord gave to the dead when he lay 
down like them beside them.
Rise up and come forth and sing praise to him who has raised you from 
destruction﻿Just heaven.  Really!  I expect to hear music this beautiful in Heaven when 
I am in the presence of my Savior and Lord.﻿
