Say what you may about Mormons, but their choir is super dope. ﻿“We saw His star when it rose and have come to worship Him.”   (Matthew 
2:2)﻿Koo koo koo koo﻿what an arrangement - fantastic ! - the bells sound sooooo radiant and 
angelic﻿I never get tired of watching this performance. The Bells! Thank you, 
Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and Merry Christmas to all.﻿
