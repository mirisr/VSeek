😊😊😊😊🐹🐹🐦🐦﻿VERY AWESOME﻿Great song tribute to the US Armed Forces. Who are the brave - those who 
serve mankind. We can all be listed among the brave if we choose to serve 
more than ourselves.After 20 years in the Armed Forces of the United States. I have witnessed 
the brave in combat and they were awesome.Brave song.Beautifully and sensitively done. A musical reminder of all we owe to those 
who have sacrificed some or all to protect and preserve and defend the 
cause of freedom around the globe. A tribute to all of those who have paid the ultimate price by laying down 
their lives in protection of our God-given rights and freedoms. "Who are 
the brave? Those who served and died." I hope your Sunday is wonderful and 
that tomorrow as we celebrate those Brave Ones, you give thanks for their 
sacrifices.This combat vet salutes the brave, and salutes this song. Thank you.
