orchestra and choir, led by Ryan Murphy?! Amazing.﻿I saw her perform this live one year ago and it was so beautiful! She's so 
lovely!﻿it was all wounderful laura was beautiful as was for her voice. very 
talented she is.......thanks for shareing your voice and talents with us.﻿Loved the whole concert Laura did, but this is my favorite!!  Beautiful!﻿You know Audra MacDonald owns this song so I never thought I would like 
anyone else singing it but Laura is simply amazing! It doesnt matter what 
she sings she never takes away from the original but makes me love it just 
as much in a different way. Laura is AMAZING!!!!﻿Breathtaking!  It doesn't get much better than this.  Jerome Kern sure 
cranked out some amazing tunes!﻿Talented singer.  Beautiful!﻿BEAUTIFUL....!!!﻿Oh, this is fantastic!!!﻿
