Dec. 25, 2014,      GOD  and   His  Holy  SON,   Jesus  Christ   have 
 truly  given    David   Archuleta    a   Blessed  gift   for   Singing   
good   Christian  Songs   with  the  "Mormon  Tabernacle  Choir" 
...........I  wish  to  Thank  Jesus  The  Light  of  the  World  for 
 allowing  me  to  listen  to  David  .........  God  Bless  you 
 All.......!!!  ﻿Donde puedo ver el concierto navideño completo!??﻿I was fortunate enough to be in the audience for David Archuleta's 
performance with MoTab... there aren't enough words to describe how 
incredible it was, how brilliant he was. What a blessing to be there!﻿He needs to be brave.﻿Awe. He is adorable. ﻿Thanks for sharing this! Love David's collab with Motab. Got the DVD and CD 
:)﻿Aw.  He's such a sweetheart! :-)﻿Interesting I'm not sure the Muppet's are going to need the advice, but fun 
anyway﻿Thank you for posting this.  These performances with David were wonderful!﻿So glad you got to be a part of the Christmas concert with The Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir :)﻿Voz perfeita Brasil ﻿
