I had a songwriting class once at BYU with JKP and her angry claw. She has 
mastered the art of doggerel set to a nonchanging chord pattern better than 
anyone I've known. Once when I had to play "Image in Your Countenance" at a 
funeral but the family only had sheet music for "Learn of Me," I was 
infinitely grateful to our Heavenly Father that she had written both in 
exactly the same chords. Consistent genius like this is rare. Thank you, 
Janice!﻿Jancie i move to young mens not to long ago and some say hated singing and 
the music or singing time is for babies but i must a be a baby because i 
will NEVER stop singing (And i am thankful love is spoken here ) and NEVER 
forget the sunday morning i learned this heart warming song.﻿I totally love the film. I also love Janice's music. I have of her music. 
Some of her music our fit for both the organ and piano. Just look at her 
music and you'll see what I mean.﻿
