Only one arrangement - Sir David Willcocks - may he rest in peace and rise 
with Christ in glory.﻿It dumbfounds me that people can be critical of Mack Wilberg and this 
arrangement. It doesn't hold up? Butchered? Way too rushed? Just because 
it's not your favorite arrangement doesn't mean you should publicly 
denounce it. Keep your comments to yourself and go on to something else. 

I, for one, love this arrangement. 

@pjzdreamz @doobeedoo58 @jetuber﻿I remember as a child in the early 1960's hearing this hymn done by the 
MTC. This is a slightly quicker paced "arrangement"  that doesn't hold up 
to that standard.﻿this is something different, and i like it.﻿Wow.. The song is to fast, and with the loud fanfare it didn't sound like 
they care about it. The music ruined everything. I want acapella!﻿hark all  the angels sing that  the  glory  to the new born king  for all 
of us  one of my favorites﻿Ps - I don't really mind Mack's arrangement of this, I think from a musical 
point of view Felix Mendelssohn and Charles Wesley would have approved.....﻿Can Mack Wilberg butcher this song any worse....dagnabbit...Mack Wilberg 
keep your arranging butcher knife to yourself﻿Sorry, but I didn't like this version. Way too fast. Although the MTC are 
superb, listen to an Anglican Cathedral or Church choir in full voice, 
complete with descant on the last verse. There's nothing better.﻿This is very good!﻿Not terrible, but I prefer the Anglican versions﻿“I’m ever and always a stranger to grace. I need this annual angel 
visitation... to know the virgin conceives and God is with us.” - Eugene H. 
Peterson﻿Im not religious, but I love listening to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, its 
beautiful music.﻿IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS!!!﻿I don't like how they had to change the lyrics. The song goes "veiled in 
flesh, the Godhead see; Hail the incarnate deity!" But, since Mormons don't 
believe in the Trinity, they cut that out and substituted it.﻿
