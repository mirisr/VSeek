It's such a joy to see Ryan Murphy conduct!  He smiles.  When he smiles, 
so  does the choir!  Mack WIlberg  might learn a lesson from this.  Check 
out Spencer Kinard's piece, "The Worth of a Smile." Rejoice and be Glad!﻿Beautiful, I know that church of Jesus Christ of Latter days Saints is 
true, I feel the beautiful spirit in my heart.﻿
