Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I have always loved this song!﻿can we share this on Facebook?﻿My two oldest daughters used to sing the most precious duets of this 
"Somewhere Out There" musical piece when they were much younger.  They 
sounded exactly like the two people who sang it in "An American Tail."  
Today the oldest of the two girls just celebrated her 4th Anniversary with 
MoTab this past Mother's Day. It brought tears to my eyes and heart. :-)﻿absolutely loved this version﻿
