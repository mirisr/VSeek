One of my favorite songs that didn't make the cut in my Fifth Grade Chorus 
Christmas concert. What a shame.﻿Kinder sind der Weltzivilisation das wichtigste Wesen. Das ist der Eckstein 
der gesamten Kulturgeschichte.

Children are the most important essence of world civilization. That is the 
cornerstone of all cultural history.﻿As a Mother myself...this is the ultimate, and tender lullaby.  As a song 
for the birth of The Savior, my heart is touched.﻿A moment in heaven.﻿Absolutely Beautiful!!﻿Mack Wilberg's ability to arrange pieces like this is beyond this world. 
His musical inspiration truly reflects the Spirit of the Savior. I've been 
blessed to have multiple family members in the Tabernacle Choir and 
Orchestra at Temple Square organizations, and I've experienced the Spirit 
that their music brings to the world many times. I'm grateful for the gift 
of music these talented individuals are so willing share.﻿Go to Bryn Terfel version also beautiful﻿Beautiful﻿Captures the wonder of that most glorious night. I feel chills as I listen. 
I fully believe in the Child. He is working miracles in my life today. I'd 
be lost without Him. ﻿Wonderful music! The best time of the year, Christmas time! Jesus came to 
earth to save us all!﻿
