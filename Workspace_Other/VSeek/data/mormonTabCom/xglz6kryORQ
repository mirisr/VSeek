I thank my Heavenly Parents for restoring the GOSPEL back on earth. what an 
amazing song.﻿needs more cowbell.﻿Don't say anything mean...but I can't understand why the whole world 
doesn't join the church? I know it's true. I really do. It has to be. The 
spirit always backs up the truth.﻿This is so heavenly music with nice video! I love it*****♥﻿child of the Mother﻿What an outstanding name!my baby is the child of God :) I had this snd onward christian soldiers sung at my baptism in 08. My 
favoritesthis was played at my dads baptism The only way to sound this good is if they have God's holy angels singing 
with them. So beautiful!Such peaceful feelings come to me when I hear and see this ....and I think
