Hmmm..nice arrangement. I've only hear the Marcel Dupre X-cription before 
this. Well-played and not too fast (some play it as if they have diarrhea 
of the fingers :).﻿Wow, the action is really loud on this one...﻿Congratulations. So beautiful.We were privileged to be in attendance for this particular performance and 
were absolutely mesmerized at this wonderful performance! Richard Elliott 
is a world class performer. Add to his extensive talents the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir and the Orchestra at Temple Square and you have an event 
that will stay in your memory for years to come. I love to listen to pipe organ music. The Tabernacle Organists are great 
musicians. Love to listen to and watch them perform these solos.An absolutely incredible performance...Johann Sebastian Bach is smiling and 
enjoying Richard Elliot's performance. Qué interpretación! Bella, difícil, e impresionante.
