To imagine entering Heaven gates to a Celestial Choir that is endlessly 
better than these robust, beautiful voices is just...achingly unfathomable. 
And I look so forward to it!﻿Give a listen to a version of this song done by The Westminster Chorus. 
 The are singing in The Petrikirche Cathedral in Dortmund, Germany.  (as an 
aside, the construction of the Cathedral began in the year 1322)  You will 
not be disappointed and I doubt you will soon forget what you hear.   ﻿stunning! Move over, top ten!It is one of my favourite songs. I am not a Mormon. But use sung it the way 
it should be slow and moving. Thank You.This is one of my Favorite songs that the Choir has sung! I love this!! 
Thank you!! I hope this will be on a future CD somedayLovely rendition. I have never heard this song. I am glad to discover new 
songs like this one sung by this great choir. What a lovely arrangement 
too. Thanks Mr Murphy!
