Surely they didn't disassemble & reassemble for *every* stop on the tour??﻿I'm an organist and that was really cool when they put the organ together.﻿Yes, this is a Hauptwerk setup. So cool for the Choir to now have the 
sounds of a major pipe organ to accompany them. Not sure, but I believe 
they are using Salisbury as the instrument. It would be fun to see the 
specs on the audio they used.﻿What was the actual time to put the organ together?﻿This is the worst Ikea commercial I've seen in a long time. ﻿OH MY SOOOO COOL!! Hauptwerk?﻿What company produced the instrument? Thank you! I am anxious to hear it.﻿
