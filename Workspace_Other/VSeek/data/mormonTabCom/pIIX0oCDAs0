that soprano just slayed my life at the end﻿They did that!﻿I song that In my choit﻿The song itself is a battle.﻿Corinthians 11:5﻿LOVE this!! My favorite song to sing in my high school choir :-)﻿why cant i see any black people in a choir that sings a gospel?﻿This is amasing.......﻿All I hear is "The Battle of Cherry Coke" ﻿That was perfection!!!!!!﻿Love it, especially the soloist at the end. The only thing that could make 
it better was a deep Bass "down" at the very end, but nevertheless good 
music.﻿I don´t like de mormons, but, best is best﻿This the best rendition of Joshua Fit The Battle I have ever heard, (next 
to my own choir's, of course). Awesome, Awesome job!﻿WERE singing this un choir

﻿WONDERFUL﻿These members are trained to perform in front of a camera for live 
television, and if they are caught looking at the camera they get a royal 
chew out. Elder Wilberg knows what he is doing with this Choir.Flawless!It sounds absolutely amazing, but there's no movement, no emotion in their 
faces. They look like they showed up for church, and were waiting to get 
done with performing. Like I said, there was amazing musical quality, just 
no spiritual quality.Can you please have a playlist of your songs where there are soloists from 
the members of the Choir like in this one? I remember those are my favorite 
but they're hard to find. Thanks!bravo!Lindo!! Moses Hogan was brilliant. This is well doneBuen coro so gut!!!I like the squeaky one...Awesome!The FINEST CHOIR in the WORLD.AWESOME!!!!!!!This is greatness ! The soloist is awesome ! I feel that the tenors could have been a bit louder, but overall, a very 
well done performance. My school's choir performed this just last night 
with a very similar arrangement. Well done I say! I like how musical this song is.Very, very impressive.
