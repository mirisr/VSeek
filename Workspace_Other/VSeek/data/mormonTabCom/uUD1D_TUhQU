you said it all. Thank you. I love this country and it's people. I love our inspired Constitution and 
the freedoms our forefathers provided us. I honor their sacrifice for us on 
this day the 4th of July 2013. People true freedom is so fragile never give 
it up and always defend it. Thank You Tabernacle ChoirO:-)
