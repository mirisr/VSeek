existence of a God to appreciate this ...... the realisation of 12 Days is 
one of the most charming things I have ever seen in my life.﻿How beautiful is mormon tabernacle choir ^^
May God be happy to hear it﻿i loveit so much﻿les choeur des tabarnacles de mormons , c la meilleure :)﻿“In that region there were shepherds.”  Theologians?  No.  Captains of 
industry?  No.  The message came to this blue collared bunch, who heard it, 
checked it out, and spread it.  No reports were filed.  No councils were 
convened.  No committees were formed.  Still wonder why God chose 
shepherds?﻿Absolutely wonderful﻿A wonderful preparation for the Great Feast of the Birth of Christ.  Truly 
inspiring.﻿Magical Christmas Treasure.﻿Wonderful spirit in this music!﻿Absolutely beautiful!  It's nice to see so many smiling faces and to 
hear laughter !  And... they actually acknowledged the awesome orchestra!  
Thank you for an enthusiastic start to the Christmas Season!  ﻿Love this song!!!!!!!﻿Thanks, Mormon Chanel... I'm very proud to be LDS...﻿You have to admit they brighten our skies. Thanx the music is heavenly.
