We sang this in high school choir. One of my favorites and the MTC does it 
so beautifully.﻿Such a beautiful piece, and their articulation is right on pointe!﻿Sorry, but for such a great choir, this version is so melba toast it's 
pitiful.  Worse than watching paint drying.﻿This kind of piece is exactly what the Choir was meant for. This is 
excellent. I like to think Mendelssohn would be pleased.﻿Thank you so much The Salt Lake City Choir﻿
