The intro speech is in the full concert.I watched her intro to the performance when it aired. Her grandpa was an 
airman in Korea, I think. And he'd sing this to her as a lullaby, and he'd 
sung it with his fellow airmen. The lyrics are beautiful (she introduced 
the song with them), but she does an amazing job. Stellar violinist.I think the backstory behind this arrangement is this: her grandfather was 
a military veteran and he sang this lullaby to her....And everywhere that Lindsey went, the lamb was sure to go."(...) arranged by Lindsey Stirling and Sam Cardon." I think it's awesome 
how she's envolved in every step of her music both perfomance and 
producing! Definitely an amazing talent!Sad story behind that song. It's so huge that she could play that song with 
the MoTab! Surely one of her greatest moments.I loved this. Thank you for posting it. I wish you had added her intro 
speech because this song is a very appropriate prayer for the human race 
and the world.
