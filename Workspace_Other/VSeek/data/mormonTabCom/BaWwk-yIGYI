Nice arrangement, Andy!﻿I stay in South Africa and I am a huge fan of the Mormon Tabernacle choir 
since the age of 16! I am now 43 and still love your performances. We do 
not have the privilege to see choirs like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. One 
of my big dreams is to be able to visit Mormon Tabernacle Choir and attend 
one of their performances. I always dreamed of playing the church organ and 
started with lessons when I was still at school but had to stop it after I 
finished high school. Love the organ works as well. Thank you for uploading 
your works and performances to YouTube so that guys like me am able to 
watch it.  ﻿- And happy new year to you ,
from Laurel Rule﻿Nice, Andy. Good on ya.﻿
