loneyliness.﻿Cuan tiemamente Jesús hoy te llama﻿Inspiring, thought provoking, introspective, and amazing. Thank you.﻿Come to Jesus, find peace to your soul.﻿We performed this at my mother's funeral. It always had special meaning to 
her, which pertained to a story about her infant son dying.My mother is dying, and all I can think of is this song.a week ago right before this video was posted i was asking myself if i 
would ever see the tabernacle choir singing this again and voila here it 
is. Amazing as alwayshere I am o Lord, I am coming home. Thanks for creating such a gorgeous 
video!que musica linda! What a wonderful song!
