I am not a Mormon, but I have always loved the Tabernacle Choir.  They are 
one of the best!!!!  God Bless Them..﻿As I grow older and perhaps wiser, I marvel at the wondrous things God's 
saints have made with His Son's creations. Is there no end to all this?

The millions of saints, while striving to learn more of their Father in 
heaven and His Son, Jesus Christ, do so beautifully magnify BOTH as they 
learn from THEIR creations.

It is our duty to know our Father and His Son's creations that we may 
constantly strive to as they are and thereby build to welcome Christ's 
return to Earth - a new heaven and a new earth where He shall reign forever 
and ever and the saints shall have total knowledge of all of God's 
creations - EVERYTHING!
