I'm sure John Philip Sousa smiles every time Richard Elliott plays that 
song.  Likewise, I'm confident that the iconic Alexander Schreiner, the 
Granddaddy of Tabernacle organists, is delighted to see someone of Richard 
Elliott's caliber continuing the tradition of great Tabernacle organists.﻿I really want this music. Rick Elliott is an absolute GENIUS.﻿And now for something completely different...﻿Rich is my favorite organ player.﻿Wonderful!  Another virtuoso performance from Ric Elliott..... ( Not, as 
originally marked, though recently changed...) albeit incorrectly 
attributed to  the also very excellent Andrew Unsworth....﻿That's Richard Elliott, not Andrew Unsworth. :)﻿
