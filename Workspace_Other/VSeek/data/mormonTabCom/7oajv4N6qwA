amazing! I love Santino Fontana!﻿nice.  Reminds me of when use to see all those muscial movies.﻿This is one of the most entertaining choirs out there. :D hahaha﻿Felt "Happy" to see Santonio live in SLC. What a fabulous performance!﻿This is the perfect melody for all you optimists.﻿Don't like the ending chord at all. But I really enjoyed the performance of 
the program when I watched it on t.v. Wow!!!!! (LOL on Ashley Nicole. (Not 
to offend her.) The choir only choose people who are real on 
celebrities. Santino is a celebrities. He's from Disney's frozen as the 
back guy. (Don't remember his name.) Don't see the comparative. Watch the 
movie. 'Frozen".))         ﻿I've watched this lots of times so I could sing it at my school talent show 
﻿wow!!!... really this is cool!﻿Is there any way we can see the show online??﻿20 people are un-happy! Find them and hug them!﻿Please have an Asia tour, Santino! I'm sure listening to you sing live 
would bring me double the goosebumps.﻿its my most favorite music it is uplifting thanks﻿QUEM QUISER A LETRA DESTE MEDLEY É SÓ PEDIR. ﻿How is he so good all the time though? Are we sure that Santino's real? 
Like is there any proof of that yet? Someone get science on it ASAP.﻿
