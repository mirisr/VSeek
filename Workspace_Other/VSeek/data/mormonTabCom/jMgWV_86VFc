BTW, if I am not mistaken this is not the Tabernacle Organ but the one 
"across the street" at the Conference Center.﻿Maravilhosa apresentação organistica e orquestral. Show! Não canso de 
assistir.﻿Ottimo

Delightful!!﻿This is the best thing I have ever listened to! Now, please excuse me, I 
have to go find my jaw. It dropped to the floor and it's still somewhere, 
waiting to be recovered.﻿Love to see all are working together in a uplifting harmony!﻿That organ LOOKS way too good for "left toe poking" :-)﻿All of you of the mormon tabernacle orchestra and you Richard elliot may 
one day play some songs maybe calling the conductor john wilson to play 
some symphonic big band pieces or similar?﻿Słucham tego , słucham i nie mogę się nasłuchać, Wspaniałe 
wykonanie..Wielkie brawa dla Pana Richarda﻿Wspaniała muzyka i aranże. Jestem pod wrażeniem wykonawców i Pana Richarda﻿Pedal line rocked the whole orchestra!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!﻿Does anyone know if MoTab's summer performances are put onto cds? I want to 
say probably not, but if anyone knows for sure that would be awesome!﻿Loved the hot pipes Richard!﻿4:33 Pretty good clarinet.﻿Music - The food of God﻿Musically how is called the musical part from 2:12 to 2:19 with strings and 
 2:22 to 2:27 with  brass ?﻿mega, ultra amazing, fantastic!!!﻿
