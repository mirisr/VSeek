How refreshing it is to hear a 21st century, highly-trained musician with 
considerable performance experience turn back, just a very few years, to an 
southwest American composer's score - a man who composed a considerable 
amount of music for the church and for wedding services, as well. Dr. David 
N. Johnson had a fine working relationship with Augsburg Publishing House, 
Minneapolis as well as with Concordia, St. Louis, both well known for 
searching for and publishing high quality music for organ, solo singers and 
choirs. His untimely death, a swimming accident in his own home, was a very 
sad ending to what was a wonderful career as composer, arranger and church 
musician: organist / director of choirs. Thank you, Brother Unsworth, for 
reminding us of the very good qualities of David's life and works.﻿Beaufiful imagery with the music! But pity for all the static clicks in 
this recording, can they be removed please?﻿Love it!﻿
