I work at the las vegas airport and i get to see some pretty awesome sun 
sets their are pretty cool makes my day go ligther since am only half way 
my shift ﻿I remember seeing a male deer walking along a dirt path to my right . 
Moments like this may pass away for others like tears in the rain , for me 
they shall ever remain !﻿
