Lovely rendition. Our high school choir joined 2 other high school choirs 
back in 1975 to be able to sing this at our Baccalaureate and I have to 
say....our 3 huge choirs sounded just like these wonderful singers. I cried 
through the entire song and could barely sing. Too bad that the world can't 
grasp these wonderful lyrics today and take them to heart.
You did a lovely and peaceful rendition MTC! Thank you.ï»¿
