What a great story of the Christmas Spirit.  Thank you for this post.﻿Jack Stone: Your comments have nothing to do with this beautiful Christmas 
presentation. If you want to learn about someone, you don't ask their 
enemies. Go to the source, in this case, the Savior about whom this 
presentation is. The name of the Church is The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. That should tell you something about what and whom we 
believe in. If you don't want to take the trouble to find out for yourself, 
then go to other You Tube sites and leave room here for people who 
appreciate fine music and the joy in offering their efforts to our Lord.﻿Thank you!.Life was getting in the way of the Christmas Spirit. I have been 
really struggling this year. In less than 30 minutes my heart was opened 
and flooded with that warmth of feeling I was missing.﻿Thank You! My Great Uncle was a pilot in WW II and so this really resonated 
with me.﻿Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd I'm crying.  That was beautiful.﻿Lovely.﻿mormons believe in joseph smith﻿
