wow.﻿If anyone ever gets the chance, you need to come to Philadelphia to hear 
this played on the Wanamaker Organ. Keith Chapman used to play this on it, 
and Peter Conte still does to open the Christmas concerts.﻿The amount of music he has stored in his head is phenomenal!  I hope to be 
able to see him in concert (as well as, the choir and orchestra) one of 
these days!  This is one of my favorite renditions of Jeanette Isabella! 
 He plays it as it is supposed to be played, with the right tempo and 
correct settings.  Beautiful!!!﻿Great music... but why mormons?﻿Awesome. I also LOVE the new camera angles recently. I like to see that 
organ has some wear too! (The music stand)﻿Wonderful concert. One more amazing piece of music with Rich Elliot﻿Thanks for posting this!﻿
