I'm not at all sure who posted this video...or why, but what I will tell 
you is that I don't believe I'd be ale to sit through an entire concert 
given by these really wonderful voices and people. My time in service to 
this nation is greatly rewarded time after time when I view such videos so 
to who ever posted this, Thank You. Very very much.

EYES RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿May we NEVER take our God given freedoms for granted.  May we drown out the 
negative hateful voices of the world by our joyful cries of FREEDOM and 
liberty for all!﻿Four days until Memorial Day 2015 and only 271 views of last years 
presentation by the most accomplished vocal ensemble in the world.  Sad to 
see so much indifference to memorialize those who made the ultimate 
sacrifice for our country.

As an old man I admit I do not understand why the youth of today have such 
a jaded view of their heritage.  Such was not the case during my lifetime 
in WWII, Korea or Vietnam.  If our country is to survive, young people must 
step up and demonstrate their allegiance by supporting (and joining) the 
military services that are charged with the responsibility of keeping us 
free.

May God bless our military combat veterans past and present.
