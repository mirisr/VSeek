I testify from the bottom of my heart, with the intensity of my soul, to 
all who can hear my voice that those apostolic keys have been restored to 
the earth, and they are found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. To those who have not yet joined with us in this great final cause 
of Christ, we say, “Please come.” To those who were once with us but have 
retreated, preferring to pick and choose a few cultural hors d’oeuvres from 
the smorgasbord of the Restoration and leave the rest of the feast, I say 
that I fear you face a lot of long nights and empty nets.﻿Is this from a session of conference?  I'd really like to download the 
audio but can't find it.﻿me encanta como canta el coro del tabernáculo y en especial este himno es 
maravilloso
