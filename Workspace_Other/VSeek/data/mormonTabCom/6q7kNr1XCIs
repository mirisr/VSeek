Sounds like a Heavenly fairytale tune, so beautiful..﻿Simply beautiful.﻿Too bad, they are capable of so much more. The music steps on the lyrics 
quite badly - the overlapping lyrics even more so.﻿So sweet, and here are the words:

Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart,
be all else but naught to me, save that thou art;
be thou my best thought in the day and the night,
both waking and sleeping, thy presence my light.

Be thou my wisdom, be thou my true word,
be thou ever with me, and I with thee Lord;
be thou my great Father, and I thy true son;
be thou in me dwelling, and I with thee one.

Be thou my breastplate, my sword for the fight;
be thou my whole armor, be thou my true might;
be thou my soul's shelter, be thou my strong tower:
O raise thou me heavenward, great Power of my power.

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise:
be thou mine inheritance now and always;
be thou and thou only the first in my heart;
O Sovereign of heaven, my treasure thou art.

High King of heaven, thou heaven's bright sun,
O grant me its joys after victory is won;
great Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
still be thou my vision, O Ruler of all.﻿A beautiful account of this irish meoldy.  Such sophistication,  rarely 
encountered.﻿Wonderful, inspirational song, many thanks for listing it.﻿MAKES MY HEART SING TO LISTEN TO SUCH WONDERFUL GOSPEL MUSIC.So beautiful. A missionary just asked us to send him this. I can see why! For several years, my job took me to Salt Lake City. I tried to stay nears 
the temple and on Wednesday evenings I would sit in on choir practice. For 
the past 14 years, I have been in mission in Latin America, and the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir has been a blessed companion. Thank you, and God bless 
you. LINDO!proud Irish Catholic!I served in DC, too! I fell in love with this piece on my mission, too. 
Well, at least the tune. The lyrics were different (Take Time to be Holy).
