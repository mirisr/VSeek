Dang! They sound good no matter where they are or when they start singing! ﻿MoTab's Got Talent!!!﻿So happy to have had a chance to see the Choir and Alex at Strathmore on 
6/25. Awesome concert!﻿The world needs more people like Alex Boye :)﻿And right after your beyond amazing America's Got Talent debut!!!!

You're already "arrived", America's just behind..... ;0)﻿Alex your so funny.﻿looks joyous. :D i love to sing church hymns always. :)﻿Did he finished his participation in AGT ?﻿If everyone on the plane was a member then I think this would be cool. If 
there were non-members then this would have been another reason for people 
to think we are weird lol.﻿This just makes me happy :D﻿I'm confused so did Alex Boye not make it in Americas got talent or is he 
some how able to do both tour and go on a Americas got talent?﻿normally on road trips i dont like people singing it gets old fast, but 
this would be one of the groups you would never get tired to go on a road 
trip with lol﻿Hooray for 'spontaneous' breaking into song in an enclosed space!
It's a lot more fun than I made it sound just now...﻿
