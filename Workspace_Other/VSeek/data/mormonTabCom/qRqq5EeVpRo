wow !!!﻿Although this person is a Evangelical Christian, this person finds this 
video beautiful. Why the 3rd person? For Christmas and Easter videos, Jesus 
Christ should always be the first person. This is not a denial of the Holy 
Trinity.  ﻿O verdadeiro Natal!! Lindo coral!!﻿Great Choir👏﻿The three who disliked this are nuts﻿Hay wá﻿Leave it to Mack Wilberg to always come up with the best possible 
arrangement of any song. And the choir performs beautifully every single 
time. A world class choir for sure.﻿
