This should be our National anthem!﻿WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL  I LEARNED THIS HYMN IN THE LUTHERN CHURCH AS WELL 
AS BEING ABLE TO SING IT WITH MY FELLOW GIRLSCOUTS AT OUR MEETINGS IN THE 
50,S . NOW AS A 73 THREE YEAR ADULT I STILL SING IT AND TO ME IT IS THE 
MOST  MAJESTIC  HYMN IN ALL CHRISTANDOM. THE WORDS EXPRESS THE CHERISHED 
BELIEFS OF  ALL CHRISTIANS NO MATTER WHAT BECOMES OF THIS WORLD THESE WORDS 
ARE THE TRUTH OF THE REALITY O F GOD﻿Another wonderful hymn.
The only con;during the entire song all the musicians  are hidden by the 
excessive images and landscape added to the video.
I prefer watch the video without all that pictures and scenery.﻿May God raise up mighty prayer warriors who will fervently pray for our 
once great nation who honored and loved our God,  may he raise up laborers 
into the Harvest armed with the Truth the salvation is through Jesus 
Christ.  May His name be blessed on earth as it is in heaven. What an 
awesome song. Thank you for posting it.﻿Beautiful! Good job, Mormons!﻿The things of God Are true and eternal, and they are the only source by 
which men can return to him.......﻿The true and faithful to their beliefs need to endeavor to persevere. Good 
song﻿天父我神 (329)﻿Not a Mormon, but I love this Choir!   :-)﻿Amen!﻿Dit is een top koor geweldig ik hoop van harte dat ze een keer naar 
Nederland komen gr Maarten﻿try Natalie Cole ... Youtube won't let me link to it, so search Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir with Natalie Cole and watch her as Soloistbonito himno interpretado por el mejor coro del mundo el Coro del 
Tabernaculo Mormon,de la unica y verdadera iglesia de Jesucristo,la cual si

America.So what?If you watch some of their other music videos, you will see choir members 
of different races. I did not see one single black person or any other race for that matter in 
this choir. Moving, sending tears in my eyes.ANOTHER GREAT HYMN SUNG BEAUTIFULLY BY THE MTC.Very beautiful. Oh, wow... haven't hear this hymn in such a very long time!! Beautiful!
