Somewhere Out There is a song that has been on my mind over the last year. 
I guess you got my telepathic song request.﻿I finished reading the Book of Mormon, and now I'm reading it for the 
second time. Since June 2015 I have been going to the Mormon Church on 
Sundays. Although I haven't gotten baptized yet because my family hasn't 
warned up yet to the idea of me converting from Catholic to Mormon. None of 
my relatives are Mormons, although I am a decent of the Pioneering Mormons.﻿
