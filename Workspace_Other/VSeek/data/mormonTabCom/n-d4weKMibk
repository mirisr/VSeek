Beautiful playing... UGLY Harp!....﻿I've never seen a Salzedo in red, before! Beautiful!﻿WOW O_O﻿Bravo Emmanuel! One of the greatest harpists performing so musically. So 
lucky to have him perform in Utah. ﻿Such an amazing piece, and so well performed. We so rarely get to hear the 
harp performed as a solo instrument; thanks for this!﻿
