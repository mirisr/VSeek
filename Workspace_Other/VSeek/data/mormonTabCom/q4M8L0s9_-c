Welsh, not English. There are several translations in existence, your 
church uses a slightly different one. Frankly, neither common English 
translation is very true to the original Welsh, but that's really common 
when you translate hymn texts.Another great song and musical backup from this great world choirHermoso Coro, esta canción llega al corazón de las personas, al escuchar 
este tipo de canciones mi corazón se rebosa de alegría, es verdaderamente 
maravilloso.Conmovedor mi corazón rebosa de alegría al escucharlos les amo Are you talking about the LDS hymnal? They're different just because LDS 
writers chose to change the words to fit the church, especially when it was 
first starting out. Sometimes you can see "Used with permission from ~~~~ 
church" along with the author/writer/lyricist at the end of the hymn. Or at 
least that's what I think. There's probably a better, more gospel related 
answer, but that's the reason I can think of right now.Excellent rendition! I was wondering if I can ask a question... I have 
heard this song being sung at significant events like the Royal Wedding a 
couple of years ago, but the lyrics were very different from the ones in 
our hymnal. I'm just curious as to why they're so different.Best hymn ever......great rendition.....my soul has been blessed tonight.
