Lovely, lovely, lovely!!﻿To those who may have lost a loved one within the past year...and who might 
be celebrating this Easter Holiday for the first time without them...watch 
this broadcast!  I promise you'll feel their love and presence.  
These shared beliefs of  the Savior's Everlasting Gift 
of Resurrection..and the Lord's Renewal of Life, are Triumphan!.﻿A wonderful Easter hymn in every way.﻿Another absolutely moving rendition of the Hallelujah Chorus by the Choir.  
I challenge anyone to listen to it and not be moved. ﻿Muito inspirador﻿
