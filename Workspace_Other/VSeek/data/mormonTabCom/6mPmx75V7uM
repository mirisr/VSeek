It's simply beautiful - - even for me as a "non-American".ï»¿what I'm about to say I want to be able to write and at the same time 
express how I feel deep inside. MY MOTHER USED TO REMIND ME, WHENEVER WE 
WOULD HEAR THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER PLAYED OR DURING THE FOURTH OF JULY 
CELEBRATIONS, HOW GREAT OUR COUNTRY IS. I HUMBLY TESTIFY THAT SHE WAS SO 
RIGHT AND YES EVEN TODAY SHE IS STILL SO RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME 
THAT WE ARE STILL A GREAT NATION UNDER GOD...AND GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD 
BLESS THE UNITED STATES.I was in the Conference Center for the rehearsal - it was a great moment in 
my lifeHoly cow, those bells! That was amazing. I love to hear the Tabernacle 
Choir sing Patriotic Songs. I wish programs like these were broadcast 
through the school districts.Children are losing the values of patriotism 
and the reasons why this country is great! I heard them sing live when I went to Salt Lake City. There's no other 
experience like it. They're truly amazing."Amazing" Thank you Lovely! What an energizing aspect of my day!
