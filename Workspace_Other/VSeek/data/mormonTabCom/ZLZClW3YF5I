I really enjoyed Wat a melodious, spirit filled songs, on earth if we can 
sings this much beautiful than how much more in heaven will be enjoy﻿it made me cry..the best ever version..so much goosebumps! love it!!!!﻿wounderful﻿There is a recording of this arrangement done several years ago.  I don't 
know when or on from what album I got in from, but it is even better than 
this version.  By far my favorites rendition of this amazing carol.﻿I have always been incredibly inspired by Ms. Patty's singing and David's 
wonderful, heavenly arrangements. He has a gift no one can logically 
explain and they are all a joy to listen to as well as perform. I have had 
the privilige to have performed many of them on 1st horn and am just as 
excited to perform this very arrangemnt of O Holy Night on December 12th.﻿Ain't over until the lady sings﻿This kicked my spirit up a few notches. Awsome!﻿Now that was powerful. Nice ending. AWESOME soloist. This oh holy night 
version was done to perfection . ﻿
