That was really cool that Zak got to hear and see the Mormon Tabernacle 
Choir live and that he is also a #1 big fan of them. I'm also a #1 big fan 
of the Mormon tabernacle Choir. I play the organ and piano, so I like 
watching Richard Elliott and the other organist. #1 big fan of them. And my 
dream is to become tabernacle organist like Richard Elliott and the others.ï»¿
