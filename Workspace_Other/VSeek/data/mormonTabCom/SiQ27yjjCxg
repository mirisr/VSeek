Wondering how many of the Tabernacle Choir have found their angels... I 
know I found mine... wonderful song :)﻿Epic. ~ ❤﻿I need the lyrics!﻿That was amazing. The choir just made that song spinach fuller. I remember 
I loved this song when I saw it performed on Broadway by Santion but oh 
that was so different it was beautiful. I can get over how different it 
was.﻿Simplemente perfecto, bellísimo! Amo a Santino﻿The prologue is lovely indeed. ﻿This is so perfect!﻿
