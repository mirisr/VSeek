What a joy to see a conductor actually smile !!!  Mac Wilburg could take a 
lesson from his assistant.  Perhaps Mac should read Spencer Kinard's "The 
Worth of a Smile." His incongruence of affect is disturbing.  I've never 
seen someone conducting "Rejoice" or "Alleluia"  with such a stern, serious 
face.  I think he may be diagnosed with terminal seriousness.ï»¿
