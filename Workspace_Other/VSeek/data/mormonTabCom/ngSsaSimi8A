angelic voices with this dedicated diligent choir and their awesome equally 
dedicated and diligent and very talented conductor Mack Wilberg and an 
amazing talented and diligent devoted symphony. Let our Savior be praised. 
Let glory be to God in the highest for He alone is worthy. Mack Wilberg 
surely displayed his Handel like inspiration from our Lord and Savior thank 
you so much Choir. Symphony and Mack Wilberg for your tireless efforts on 
the world's behalf. There will be naysayers until Satan is bound. Until 
then believe this Our Savior approves of every song you sing and knows your 
devotion and hearts please ignore the naysayers they are from the dark side 
in that great and spacious building mocking at those righteous of God's 
children who are focused on walking on the straight and narrow path to the
