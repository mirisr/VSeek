Never fails to bring me peace. ﻿Yes, a VERY lovely song with words of much meaning; am so sorry to hear of 
your loss, but, it is Heaven's gain!  Sheridan, you do not know me, but, 
because of Gift's from Him, I have left my body over 45 yrs now, and KNOW 
in my soul that life lives on.....you WILL see your loved ones 
again...God's blessings to you always, Juta Semmel﻿
