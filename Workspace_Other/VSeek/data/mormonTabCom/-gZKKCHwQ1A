Unfortunately, the score is out of print, but was published by the 
Concordia Publishing House. You may want to contact them about it or try a 
library (there are some on WorldCat.org that have it in their catalog). 
Sorry this isn't a happier answer. The full title is "Prelude, Air & 
Recessional", part of Concordia's "Music for a Sunday Morning" series.Essas organistas sempre tocam as mais belas e harmoniosas melodias ao som 
do órgão! Parabéns à essas organistas pelo talento de tocar um órgão de 
tubos como esse!Does anyone know where I can find the music for this song? I want to do it 
for a postlude for a church service.
