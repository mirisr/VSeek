Thank God for Home...I really appreciate this religious song. I'm longing 
for the Heavenly where we all will be there. I love to sing this song 
there. Praise God﻿I am a former Mormon, but now an avowed atheist. Over the years I have 
grappled with many conflicting feelings about religion. I have come to a 
place where I can appreciate the good that can come from someone's faith, 
and this music represents the absolute best result of that.﻿Com Amor no Lar...este hino está no Hinário adventista, e - eventualmente - 
em alguns outros, e coletâneas diversas. Muito simples, e bonito...merece 
maior
divulgação no Brasil.﻿I'm no fan of organised religon sorry about that, but hey compare this kind 
of MUSIC to the trash people listen to nowadays in the name of POP Music.
Regardless if it is or it isn't sinful or not today MUSIC is utter trash to 
the ears and spirit!
I've always admired the Mormon tabernacle Choir, and hey the Organ is such 
a magnificent piece of musical workmanship.﻿When the women started singing, my 5 year old son said "Oh, those are 
angels, right?" yup﻿
