How come they didn't show them singing?? Copyright, probably. ..
I was hoping to hear some of the best of Woodstock by the choir! 
They should sing" Turn, Turn, Turn" - It IS Scripture! They could even do 
Joe Cocker. .."With a Little Help From My Friends "...(the "getting high" 
part could just be "getting high" on the joy if life, too!)﻿The Mo Tab at Woodstock!! Who knew?!﻿WOW!!!!! those many people in that picture? WOW!!!!!! I'm surprise about 
that.﻿
