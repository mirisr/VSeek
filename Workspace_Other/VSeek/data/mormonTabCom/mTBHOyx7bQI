What a great opportunity!﻿Awesome! I especially like the informal attire.﻿Lovely insight into the MTC.... very charming and endearing...  Nice to see 
them in rehearsal ... and 'civvies'...﻿The business-casual attire was a little jarring at first, but then you 
realize it just looks so much more comfortable, welcoming, and inviting - 
vs. imposing or intimidating etc. It makes them look homely and amateur, 
which is nice now and then.﻿
