I saw this performed live at a Music and the Spoken Word some years ago - 
it was stunning. The power of the MoTab in full flight was spine tingling 
stuff!﻿I love this hymn. It's very intense but very beautiful! ﻿Mount and Blade Warband 1860s old America module.
Am i the only one?!?!﻿You don't need to be a believer to appreciate beautiful music. (I'm not 
trying to start a flame war.)﻿Dose the promised land happen be northern Utah by any chance? ;p﻿amo essa música !!!The only way journey!I like this performance, but I recently sang this anthem, and I can't help 
but notice that the tempo is much much higher than the composer (who is the 
conductor) specifies in the score.I love Bound for the Promised Land -- especially when I see my bestest 
friend, Claudia, playing in the orchestra!!I had the opportunity to watch this performed live the day they recorded 
it. It was spectacular! I think if they would have sung this song while crossing the plains, they 
would have gotten their quicker.
