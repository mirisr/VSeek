I was lucky enough to perform alongside and be in a band with Santino in 
the late 90's, during our high school years; if you would have told me back 
then that he was going to be a Broadway star (or that I'd become Mormon - 
I'm a convert!) back then, I would have been more in disbelief that I'd 
become Mormon than I would have about Santino's future as a Broadway star. 
He just "has it" -- that intangible gift -- that ability to perform and 
connect. He is a class act and an incredible talent. And I love the shout 
outs to Richland and the Tri-Cities in the beginning of this video! Our 
region is collectively so proud of Santino and his many accomplishments. :D﻿I've never heard of Santino Fontana before this performance. I now believe 
in 'Love at first Sight' I hope he comes back to Utah again to favor us 
with his talent!!!!!﻿I learned quickly to love Santino Fontana.  I liked the songs that I heard 
him sing; many of them were fun and lively.  I hope Santino comes back to 
our world again!﻿
