This music is supreme.  ﻿I heard this song for the first time (sung by a BYU choir) on my mission. 
It became an instant favorite... and this version is even better than the 
first one I heard. HAHAHAHAHAHA! From the Secret Garden! I was listening to it, (Hadn't seen 
the description yet), and I just KNEW that the song was familiar. XDDDD 
Well sung! I like it! celestial A minha vida seria bastante sem graça... sem o Coro do Tabernáculo 
Mórmon... ♫ ♥ ♫... I love it, FOREVER.Uma beleza de melodia...
