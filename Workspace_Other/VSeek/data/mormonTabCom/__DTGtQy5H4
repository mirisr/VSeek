Unbelievable but I know this song since I was 10 yeas of age and today 51 
years later I never heard a so amazing arrangement like this one. The 
conductor lead the orchestra and choir with such inspiring confidence.I love this one! it gets me excited to live the gospel each day and be an 
example to those around me :)heaven voices!!!!!!! beautiful!I love this song. You SHOULD record this song onto your next album, that 
you record. Thanks for posting.
