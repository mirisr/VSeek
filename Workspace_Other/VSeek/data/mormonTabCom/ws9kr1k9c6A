This has become a rediscovered classic I had almost forgotten. It's become 
part of my morning devotionals. I have listened to it daily for the last 
couple of weeks, and sill cannot get my fill. Thanks to everyone concerned 
for posting this wonderful anthem.﻿A wonderful reading of this great old piece. Like Mike before me, I really 
like the pictures of creation at the beginning -- so dramatic, as is the 
entire piece. Thanks, choir!﻿
