That was so funny when those people said that they were The Boston Pops 
Orchestra. On the other hand, I'm glad they are doing this to become 
missionaries. Because once they are hooked on the choir, they will have a 
strong testimony through Jesus Christ through the music of the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir and they will automatically join the LDS church because 
and through the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Thanks Choir and Choir staff for 
what you do. Without you guys, I think nobody would join the church at all. 
Keep up with the missionary work. One day you would change somebody's life. 
Anybody's life. You never know who you would change a person's life 
forever. Keep it up.﻿I just downloaded the MTC app :)
﻿I wish you came to El Salvador or any country in LatinAmerica... Maybe here 
there's more ppl who know MOTAB ;)﻿
