I never heard of "The Redemption" until this morning (2/22/15) when this 
number was on "Music and the Spoken Word."  This is a fabulous piece.  It 
is also my favorite style of music.  Don Neuen used to conduct this kind of 
music on the old "Hour of Power" program and I watched it simply to listen 
to his music.  Thanks for posting this.ï»¿iam not a mormon but i still like them.Iam 72 years young. Have been 
listening to them back in the late 50s into the 1960s
