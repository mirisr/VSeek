I want to thank the Choir for this song. I've struggled with many emotional 
troubles throughout my life and whenever I can't take it anymore, I come 
and listen to this song. To me, it's not just a beautiful testament to the 
love my father and I share, it's also a personal message from my Heavenly 
Father. Whenever I listen to this song, it's like he's telling me himself 
that everything is going to be okay because he's always with me. It's 
helped me get through so much in my life, thank you. ï»¿
