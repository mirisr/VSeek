Aaack! I can't believe they had that glorious choir right there, and didn't 
use them for "All The Things You Are"; as lovely as it sounded here, it 
could have been heart-and spirit-exploding.﻿Maravilha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿Very good spectacl , enjoy tebernacle lds . I love you﻿She's a great singer but as annoying as gosh darn heck.﻿LAURA!!! <3﻿My first ancestor born in the United States was Joseph Thomas Winkless in 
1847. He, his sister, and his relatives were a part of the Pioneering 
Mormons. His parents were going to be Pioneering Mormons, but they died in 
the Saint Louis Cholera Epidemic. My ancestor Joseph Thomas Winkless was 
also the general contractor for the Mormon Tabernacle. My other ancestor 
Samuel Priday was a decorative artistic mason for the Salt Lake City 
Temple.﻿bien fait mon frère

Osnes
did a beautiful  "Music for a Summer Evening".
Greetings from Chile﻿I love it !﻿What GLORIOUS music! One concern.  Doesn't Mac Wilberg EVER smile? He is 
always scowling. Is he suffering from terminal seriousness? Apparently he 
never read Spencer Kinard's book, The Worth of a Smile.﻿hermoso concierto, muy inspirador﻿FANTÁSTICO, MARAVILLOSO!!!!
GRACIAS POR COMPARTIR!!!!!!﻿Amazing concert with the best music ever.
At the end the two conductors should also receive flowers for their superb 
performance. They are the best.﻿Beautiful
.....﻿Un ottimo strumento per toccare i cuori, unire i diversi sentimenti 
religiosi, annullare i nazionalismi prevaricanti, far convergere culture 
diverse, divertirsi, gioire e pregare insieme. Un'espressione di alta 
professionalità!﻿Spectacular - no other words are sufficient to describe.﻿goto min 29 approx. for All the Things You Are﻿Que mas puedo escrivir lindo,lindo,lindo y lindo
Gracias﻿I truly enjoyed this performance! I love Laura's voice and she's so 
stunning!﻿Can anyone pls explain to me what Pioneer Day is﻿the best! <3﻿Really enjoy! Thank you for sharing!﻿Musica para escuchar, alegrar, recordar, meditar y para todos los gustos.﻿I wish to express my gratitude to the Mormon Pioneers for their example of 
courage, faith, hope and charity. These are the characteristics of those 
who have taken upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ. Your generosity 
and sacrifice knew no bounds and until the end of our posterity their steps 
will guide our paths as missionaries and witnesses of Christ's love.﻿Just a wonderful,beautiful,and inspiring performance by our Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir,Orchestra and a lovely,talented young Lady in Laura 
Osnes.What a Blessing as a tribute and celebration of our Pioneer 
Ancestors.﻿Excelentes conciertos ,orquesta y súper coro,bendiciones﻿É muito fabuloso!﻿I think this might be my favorite Pioneer Day concert. The cheerful spirit 
really celebrated the pioneers, and it was so fun to watch! The choir and 
orchestra were great, and Laura really glowed.﻿Laura marry me please 😩﻿We made a trip from Ca to SLC just to attend this performance and it was 
wonderful.  I've listened to "Music and the Spoken Word" all my life and 
finally realized my dream of attending a live performance of the choir. 
 Laura Osnes really added a lot and together, she and the choir created a 
memory I'll never forget.﻿July 24 is my baptism day, my temple marriage day and the pioneers day! The 
best day in the year! :) This music reflects my mood just perfectly! :) 
Thank you for posting this!!!!!﻿Happy Pioneer Day! God bless you all! ﻿Happy Friday! ﻿Mack Wilberg is truly a blessed Church treasure.﻿Great concert!!!! 

The only thing is that I am not getting much dynamic contrast coming 
through... 

That might just be my device though?

Loved it!﻿This was my first Pioneer Concert to attend and it was so moving and 
wonderful being with family and friends, especially being able to see my 
2nd generation LDS daughter singing in thee Choir made my heart within me 
swell.  The Orchestra and Choir are First Class. Everyone was moved and 
elevated to a higher level of appreciation and gratitude for our many 
blessing.  Laura was amazing and fit in so well with the Choir and 
Orchestra. We were all touched and she and her husband were 
shown appreciation at the end of the last performance with "God Be With 
You."  I especially loved the arrangement of the "Handcart Song," by Sam 
Cardoon who was also responsible for the music in the wonderful documentary 
"Meet the Mormons."﻿As wonderful as this Conference organ is...and the history and story of the 
tree from which the wooden case is made from...organist Richard Elliot 
performs and showcases this organ with such melodious sounds you just 
don't hear in Conference or Music & the Spoken Word, and I LOVE IT!  This 
guy is so brilliantly talented. Laura Osnes has the voice of an angel and 
sings beautifully with the MOTAB Choir, Orchestra, and Conductors.  
This truly is excellent uplifting world class entertainment!﻿I love Laura she is Amazing 
﻿Can't wait till I get to kneel before my Savior and SHOW him personally how 
much I love and him.﻿ein wunderschönes Konzert ,was man immer hören möchte﻿Great singer, but do the sound people have a clue what an orchestra is 
supposed to sound like? The orchestral balance is awful. I was at the 
concert as well and it was even worse live. Where are the winds and brass?﻿Absolutely beautiful!﻿Wished that close captioning was available initially.﻿Whew, that first song was hugely unique - The Magnificent 7.  A group of 
American's who liberate a small rural Mexican Village from a horrible 
bandit leader and most died in doing so.  So the the moral courage of that 
incident and the moral courage of pioneers fleeing a country that had gone 
bigoted on them only to reunite with them and become what some now call 
"Super Americans."﻿Beautiful!﻿Absolutely perfect! Thanks so much for sharing!﻿This is so great! Is there anywhere to buy and download the songs?﻿Absolutely LOVBD this!!!!!!!!!!﻿Thank you!  We were among the thrilled audience Friday and are sharing this 
link with everyone we know.  God bless you Choir, Orchestra, Mack, Ryan and 
especially Laura!!﻿bravo well done and yes laura it was a very very lovely night﻿
