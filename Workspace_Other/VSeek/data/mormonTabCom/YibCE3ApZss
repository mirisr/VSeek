At 3:50 the song referes to the sun not shinning and the moon turning to 
blood . . . I didn't remember these verses til now. Could this be a 
refereence to prophesies? I'm glad the MTC usually sings origional versions 
and entire songs.

In the last few months we have seen two blood moons. A total solar eclipse 
and two more blood moons are coming before the end of September of this 
year.
This has happened before. Blood Moons have occured on Hebrew High Holy 
Days each time and these "blood moon tetrads" have seen both horrible and 
miraculous things happen to the People of Israel. The last time we saw the 
re-establishment of the Nation of Israel as an independent, soveriegn 
country and a people not affraid to defend themselves. . . as Prophesied.
Pray and Keep your fingers crossed !
