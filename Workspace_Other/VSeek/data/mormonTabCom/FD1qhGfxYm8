Darn. When I read the "Pilgrim's Hymn" in the track list, I thought that 
the Choir had performed the "Pilgrim's Chorus" from Wagner's opera 
"Tannhäuser" (which the Choir did record with Eugene Ormandy and the 
Philadelphia Orchestra, some decades back -- and remains one of their 
all-time greatest recordings, IMO). I would LOVE to hear the choir sing 
that chorus once again.﻿
