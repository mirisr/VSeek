So beautiful! The choir was amazing as well!!!﻿I'm disappointed in the orchestration, they took out one of my favourite 
flute countermelodies! Fantastic vocalist though.﻿It's definitely a G#5 (Ab5).﻿+Laura S It is an A flat.﻿A truly beautiful song, singer and orchestra.﻿@Laura S in the original published key it is a g flat﻿Absolutely Stunning performance!﻿Talented singer and lovely song.
The choir in the background made a huge difference for better.﻿Whats the high note she hits right before the end?﻿Is Laura Mormon?﻿😀❤️ wow this is so beautiful I'm in love ﻿Wow, this is so beautiful. Love this rendition :)﻿
