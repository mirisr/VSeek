I love this piece! I sang it in college. We had words, though. Latin. I 
can't spell it, but it was pronounced "Kih-ree-ay Ay-lay-ee-sone". Good 
times. I also love to watch clouds move through the sky- so beautiful! So 
this video couldn't be more perfect. Thank you, Tabernacle Choir!ï»¿Credit Gabriel Faure for the music!!!
