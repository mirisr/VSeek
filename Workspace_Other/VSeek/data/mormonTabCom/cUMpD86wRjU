His pitch ;_; He has a habit of completely leaping for a note, and having 
it end up flat. And I understand artistic differences, but he's completely 
ignored the excitement of the song. Far too show-tuney tbh. This is meant 
to be sung with suspense, and glee, but he's just way too 'out there'. I 
dunno how to describe it.

Still, he's a great singer.﻿consistently under pitch, and quite uninspired﻿He started off quite badly and had some pitch issues, but has a nice voice 
though, and can hit those tops ones well.﻿.....some pitch problems?﻿I am forever obsessed with his voice ﻿
