Thank God for veterans!!!!! Happy Veterans Day! My dad served for for 22 
years and I am so grateful for my amazing fatherly example. Thanks also to 
military families!﻿Our choir sang this piece this morning. We learned it for this Sunday, 
September 6, 2015, because of its proximity to September 11. It grew on me 
as we learned it. It turns out that not only did it fit with the readings 
of the day, but with all of the Syrian refugees fleeing war there, it was 
even more apropos.﻿I am really enjoying singing this piece for our Patriotic Concert at 
Trietch United Memorial Church on July 5, 2015!﻿m﻿More appropriately, this beautiful piece was originally written in 1991 as 
a choral piece inspired by the release of Nelson Mandela from prison. 
"Distant Land" has since  become a tribute to the life of Nelson Mandela.﻿from a musical perspective, few groups are as close to perfect as the 
mormon tabernacle choir, bravoYes, very moving. Perfectly performed. Very moving song. Personally I do not like a lot of scenery with music of 
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir but this one was very good for the kind of 
song. SpellbindingA nice video to watch today, Flag Day..........in fact, every day so we 
don't forget. Profoundly inspiring!Beautiful.
