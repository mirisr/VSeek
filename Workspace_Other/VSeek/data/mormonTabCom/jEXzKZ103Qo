This choir is nothing less than AWESOME!!!! Thanks Be To GOD!!﻿Beautiful oboe solo.﻿May the Good Lord bless and keep you
Whether near or far away
May you find that long awaited
Golden day today

May your troubles all be small ones
And your fortune ten times ten
May the Good Lord bless and keep you
Till we meet again

May you walk with sunlight shining
And the bluebird in every tree
May there be a silver lining
Back of every cloud you see 

(........)﻿It's so lovely song...

I enjoy listening to Mormon Tabernacle Choir' song.
Thank you... (from South Korea)﻿I was restless tonight and wanted something to 'calm my nerves from the 
very frustrating national news I had viewed earlier. I found this and am 
profoundly grateful for the goodness of this holy choir. It's as though 
angels came to comfort my soul of the wickedness that now grips this 
nation. Thank you choir. I love you.﻿love this song﻿No more Mack Wilberg arrangements. His intentions are good, his choral 
craftmanship is awful﻿thank you for this song. Its not only soothing to the spirit but very 
inspiring as well. It gives hope to many people who feel abandoned at 
times. May the good Lord bless you and your families abundantly.Your 
service to the Lord gives an example to many to emulate.﻿Amazing song. It blessed me so much.
Thanks for posting.﻿What a sweet music. Touched my heart. Wonderful. Thanks The Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir!!!﻿
