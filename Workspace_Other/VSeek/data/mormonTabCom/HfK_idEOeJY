When I hear this song, I envision those hand-cart pioneers crossing the 
plains, mountains, rivers, suffering hardships, starvation, illness and 
injury, and sometimes death.  What I hear here is their heart-song of faith 
and hope and endurance.  Thank you for this beautiful song and those who 
perform it perfectly.﻿Amazing i love this song﻿Amen, amen, my soul replies, I love to sing hosanna I'm bound to meet you 
in the skies where we will sing hosanna. For we have but the one more river 
to cross and then we'll sing hosanna. That's the main part..the rest of it 
is just repetitionI have some friends before me gone who love to sing hosanna, And I'm 
resolved to travel on, for I love to sing hosanna. For we have but the one 
more river to cross and then we'll sing hosanna. One army of the living 
God, we love to sing hosanna. Part of the host have crossed the flood who 
love to sing hosanna. For we have but the one more river to cross and then 
we'll sing hosanna.Lindo! Doce, singelo, como deve ser no céu.Can anyone give me the lyrics of this amazing song?Me, too!!I have been searching for this song since I heard it in church last year- 
thank you! Amazing!Beautiful.This beautiful song took me to make a sincere and deep exame of my hear. I 
guess it's impossible not to ask myself: "What am I doing of my life? What 
are the ways my feet are going through? And at the same time, I feel peace 
and comfort. God is good!This anthem has touched me deeply ever since I first heard the choir sing 
it in a previous episode of MATSW. Thank you for posting it and for your 
beautiful ministry through music.
