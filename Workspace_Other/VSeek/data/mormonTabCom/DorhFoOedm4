Spectacular. Beautiful orchestra and choir.Videos mesmerizing. A must see!!﻿Be thankful on Thanksgiving, if you do not have HIV or Aids. World Aids Day 
is December 1. That is a date when this choir will be performing with David 
Archuleta and others .
 Be thankful for faithful , monogamous  husbands and wives. Be thankful 
teens, if you are celibate until marriage. I hope World Aids Day will be 
mentioned by many members of this choir, December 1.﻿Another fine job, thanks for these posts!!!!!!!!
All the hard work and attention to detail is appreciated.﻿
