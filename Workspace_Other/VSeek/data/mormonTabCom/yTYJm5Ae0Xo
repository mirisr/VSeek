The American accents are a little crass, but otherwise a very good 
performance.﻿Trio perfect, good music and well presented﻿Despite my disapproval of their faith, they are good, and I liked the 
organist who played so elegantly. Can someone tell me who he is ?﻿You raise me up﻿This video brings back the joyous emotion of choral performance, back in 
the days when I could,﻿My High School choirs are doing this piece, along with the Wilhousky Battle 
Hymn, and How Lovely is the dwelling place, with the Youngstown Symphony 
Orchestra April 18th. This choir does all of these pieces, very well if i 
may add.﻿They are clearly an excellent choir. The only drawbacks for me is that I 
don't like the way they dress, a bit tacky, and I think their American 
accents take the edge of the power of the words, especially the lead tenor, 
or perhaps it's because they don't have male trebles which really are the 
powerhouse.﻿Et incarnatus est﻿This is beyond my widest dreams. I want to sing with them someday, when I 
land in the States! Have performed this several times...the trio is superb! Too smooth and homogenous. You can't eschew motivic conflict in Haydn, or 
there's just nothing left.You must never have participated in this wonderful piece, it was performed 
properly. Underwhelming to say the least...The first time I heard this work was with the Benemerito de las Americas 
Choir (highschool of LDS Church in Mexico City, now Missionary center). It 
was quite an experience, I never had the chance to sing it... but the Lord 
is letting me a few days more here on earth, so, Maybe I´ll have the chanceA bit pedestrian - the Hogwood version is the definitive!
