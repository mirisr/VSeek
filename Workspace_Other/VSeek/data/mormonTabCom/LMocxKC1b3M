gostei muito.﻿Prefiro a versão do Joey﻿SING SIR!!!!!!!!﻿Sorry people but Satchmo did it SOOOOO much better.
I still love Bryn though.﻿Way too much vibrato.....﻿Bryn Terfel is one of my most inspirational voices...though, this song in 
particular lacks quite abit of charm and humility when he sings it like 
that. Soften the rough edges abit. Other than that, Maravilindas!!﻿How can one not like this.﻿The MTC and Mack Wilberg are blessed. This performance with Bryn Terfel was 
so inspiring ﻿Wonderful singing! Amazing voice. One of the top singers of the past 25 
years. Proud to have shared the stage with Bryn. Bravo!﻿is it just me but is the singer out of tune?﻿my song!!!!! i sing it ♥♥♥Hermosa melodia inmortal,excelente intérprete, Mormom Tabernacle Choir un 
coro único.Oh. My. God. This is just marvelous! :OHermosa presentación!!Simplemente hermoso!!♥ Amo esa melodia y el maravilloso coro del 
tabernaculo Mormon!! Me acerca A dios!! What higher standard were you looking for? It was a wonderful arrangement 
featuring one of the best classical singers in the world today. The song 
was performed wonderfully!Oh! How I love this song as he sings it..... It lifts my spirits sooooo 
much!!!!Never feel comfortable without listening this songI might not fully agree with the beliefs of the Mormons, but they do have 
quite the choir :)I PLAY THIS ALMOST EVERY DAY-CAUSE IT IS SO UPLIFTING!!!!! MAKES MY 
DAY!!!!! mesmerizing......I love his voice and the song, and of course the tabernacle choir!!!!! What specifically "isn't that good"? Please explain your criticism.Esta melodía es hermosa y ahora interpretada por el coro del tabernáculo 
mormon le da un toque angelical a la letra reconociendo este maravilloso 
mundo que que el padre y su hijo nos dieron durante el tiempo de nuestra 
probacion.What a wonderful song, what a wonderful choir, what a wonderful 
arrangement, and what a wonderful guest artist!
