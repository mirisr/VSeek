How fair and lovely is the hope which the Lord gave to the dead when he lay 
down like them beside them. Rise up and come forth and sing praise to him 
who has raised you from destruction﻿Praise the Lord !!!!!!!﻿A GREAT VERSION..WELL PLAYEDRichard Elliot is just awesomeI was there when he performed this, and you're right. It IS! I can only imagine the magnificence of that instrument when heard live. Magnifique -- as always -- Dick Elliott and the tabernacle organ -- an 
unmatched combination -- another superb performance!Richard Elliott is the master at this piece. It is both graceful and grand 
at the same time. And, he played it from memory no less!
