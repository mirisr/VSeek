Adoro ouvi-Los. Paz e alegria entra no meu ser.﻿This is my gift to all the mothers throughout my life. This includes my 
mother and my wife who have both passed on. It also includes my daughters 
and my  present wife and her daughters and daughters in-law. Also, my 
sister Virginia, her daughters and daughters in-law. It is also to my 
sister Louise (who has pass on) and her daughter Shawn. I know of no 
greater love and caring than you all have given.

You may enjoy this even more if you can mirror it to your big screen.
Happy Mothers Day!  Love, Carl﻿
