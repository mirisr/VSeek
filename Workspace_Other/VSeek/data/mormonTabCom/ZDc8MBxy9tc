1 play this every night. I feel close to the Savior, spiritually in tune 
quiet and reflective ....delightful and moving.﻿Back in 2009 a few days after I lost my Mother to cancer feeling so sad 
trying to feel comfort that we will see her again. I played a cd that had 
this beautiful song from the Tabernacle Choir for some reason I had not 
remembered hearing it before and the words of this song really spoke to me 
Christ is really there for us at the darkest times of our Life. Loved this 
song ever since. ﻿Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work or watch or weep this night, and 
give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ, 
give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the 
afflicted, shield the joyous—and all for your love's sake. Amen.  -
