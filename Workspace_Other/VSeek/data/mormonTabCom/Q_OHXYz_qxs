Orchestra is nice with the organ and choir, but it is very refreshing 
change when it is just the organ and choir.﻿Mr. Cornely, get a better music system; the mix of voice and organ are 
purrfect!﻿I have noticed a change in the balancing over the past ten or so years, 
with the voices being made more prominent and the organ sounding as though 
it's in another room.  In this recording the organ sounds rather tinny... 
and it is NOT!   In most English church music the organ and choir are 
considered equal and the accompaniment is as important as the choral.   The 
microphones are obviously too close to the men.   Also, women's voices 
cannot match young trebles.    Kings College, Westminster Abbey, St. 
Paul's, York, etc.﻿Too many men and doesn´t seemt o have the richness of Westminster Abbey 
voices﻿
