'BBAG#FF#C#' 이 작은 주제 하나가 굉장하기 때문에 어떤 음을 붙여도 아름다운 거다. (디즈니 곡의 음으로 하자면 ..디즈니 
원곡에는 B음으로 시작하지만 이 곡은 C로 시작한다. )﻿This is really great, but one thing that really sticks out is their 
pronunciation. A lot of these choral groups for some reason want to over 
simplify their vowels. The first one that really sticks out in this 
performance is the first vowel in 'difference.' It sounds like they are 
saying dee-ference. Otherwise, great performance﻿여긴다 외국?﻿A truly beautiful version of this lovely song.﻿Amazing song. It seems like the listener is under the skies populated by 
stars.
The temple light background was a perfect match for this song.
Congratulations and tanks for posting.﻿Love it<3﻿stunning﻿oh my goodness that was amazing﻿I cry every time.....

beautiful song. The feelings this film and song produced then, still do 
now. I laud the Choir for this grand interpretation.﻿¡Que cosa mas bella!. No se sabe si uno escucha a seres humanos o a 
angeles...﻿Say what you will about the Mormons, but this is pretty astonishing.﻿Fabulous selection thoroughly enjoyed it﻿THIS GAVE ME DISNEYLAND WITHDRAWLS SO BAD﻿Magnificent.﻿This song never gets old.﻿That last note...Goosebumps, goosebumps everywhere! <3 this!﻿Sharing this great song, stunning performance!

deaf people who didn't like this............I truly feel so sorry for them!﻿This song gave us special messages about wishing upon a star.﻿simply beautiful !﻿This choir and orchestra are exquisit!﻿Me encanta esta canción, es muy serena.﻿
