That is very well organized.
One question:since the choir are voluntary people, how do they do with 
their employers when traveling with the choir to certain length of time?﻿She insisted they never had problems. So, what would be the contingency 
plan when problems or challenges occur?﻿That's cool how they do the wardrobe. What about the men, the conductors 
and the 5 organists?﻿Cool!﻿
