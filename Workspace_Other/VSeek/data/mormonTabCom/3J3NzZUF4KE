muy emocionada al escuchar el coro del tabetnaculo y ver la tierra donde 
vivio Nuestro Salvador﻿Nice but the hebrew pronunciation is really bad﻿I wish you would make an HD version of this.  It's wonderful, and would be 
great on the big screen.﻿Mr. Ottley The best :) ﻿Oooh, my Beethoven song !!!!﻿It was really good having the 1993 Mormon Tabernacle Choir do that video. I 
wish I was in Jerusalem playing that organ, doing concerts and having 
Muslims come to those concerts hearing me playing songs that they have or 
from or to them.﻿c'est dommage que çe ne soi pa  traduit en francais, soeur henriettemartin 
de l'Eglise de Jesus - Christ des saints des derniers jours﻿A Land Called Palestine, actually.﻿
