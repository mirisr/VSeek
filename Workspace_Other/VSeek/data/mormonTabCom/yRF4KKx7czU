SIngerGuy59. Thank you for your very kind and generous offer, but with the 
greatest regret, my health no longer permits me to undertake commercial 
flights, but nevertheless I am most grateful to you for your invitation. 
With warmest regards, Peter from London.﻿Just love this version of this Hymn.  Its one of my favorite hymns too!﻿Wish I could sing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir! Everything they sing is 
so, so beautiful!﻿Luther894. Thanks for your response to my earlier post; I don't now why 
your reply doesn't appearing in the comments. Believe me, I would love to 
sit in on a rehearsal, but with the greatest regret, I do not ever see that 
happening. It would, however, be an immense privilege to be able to do so. 
It's a magnificent choir. Best wishes and blessings. Peter from London﻿The MORMON TABERNACLE CHOIR IS THE FINEST of ALL THE CHOIRS IN THE WORLD, 
AND THE LORD'S CHOIR REALLY!.Thank you Dr. Mack Wilberg.﻿I am an ELCA Lutheran from South Carolina. I play the piano and organ. 
Today (May 31), I played this for Sunday School Assembly. I did so because 
our Sunday School Lesson came from 1 Corinthians 13.﻿As always, the diction of the MTC is beyond reproach. I don't know how they 
do it, but the clarity is quite extraordinary and probably the finest I 
have heard from such a large ensemble. Absolutely beautiful!﻿HYFRYDOL. My favorite hymn tune.﻿Very beautiful - as ever.... Thank you so much for posting... I'd also love 
to hear them sing this lovely piece to the tune 'Blaenwern'I think this was played to slow, a better version of this is the Chrystal 
Cathedral Choir with organ and orchestral.Beautiful. Thank you, MTC. What is the tune to this song? It's very familiar.
