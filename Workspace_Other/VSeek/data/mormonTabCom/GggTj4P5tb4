One should say the ultimate sacrifice isn't to die for your country, but 
rather to live for it.﻿John Williams...what a Maestro!!﻿I wonder how many of us really comprehend what it means to give up your 
life for the cause of freedom.  Let's face it.- we have only one life to 
live and to die for our freedom  is, certainly,  the supreme sacrifice.  
Think about it.﻿Mister Graham,Sir, I am very sure, indeed positive that what awaits us is 
what your father and many more like him have already come to know and 
realize.  EYES RIGHT. Pass In Review.﻿Graham Bull.  My father was a regular in the Royal Marines and survived 
both the First and Second World War, dying in 1952.  I , a Soldier, 
survived the Second World War.
We are both saddened by the losses of colleagues we once knew and I'm 
absolutely sure that Dad, who appreciated beautiful music, as with myself, 
 find the "Hymn to the Fallen"  a most moving and apt piece.﻿bonito.﻿Thank you Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Ssquare...and 
thank you John Williams.  I am in awe!﻿This year I've been exploring the history of American Military Cemeteries 
all across America, and in other Countries around the World. It's even more 
humbling in reading and learning about the stories of heroism and ultimate 
sacrifice's made. It's difficult to wrap my brain around...of the lives 
that have been impacted. From American Indian Wars in Colonial Times; War 
of Independence; War of 1812; Civil War; World Wars I and II; Korean War; 
Viet Nam War; Afghanistan; Iraq.  My thoughts also embrace the heroic 
efforts from the many "Fallen American Allies"...who fought and served 
along side. Their cemeteries are just as humbling.﻿Performed with reverence and deep respect for our fallen men and women of 
the armed forces.﻿Bravos.﻿Thank you.﻿Lindo!﻿Impressive and very touching song﻿Tears came to my eyes.﻿Awesome!﻿Beautifully performed!﻿
