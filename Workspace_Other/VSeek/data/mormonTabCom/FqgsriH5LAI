Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing all this with us! I Just LOVED 
the concert, loved the wonderful arrangement of Elements - Lindsey was 
awesome as always I loved the tribute she made to her grandfather and to 
the pioneers, also for reminding all who served the country. I also loved 
Nathan Pacheco, MOTAB for sure and the wonderful orchestra!! I can't deny 
that I had goosebumps in the last song: Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing 
... It was Bravissimo!!HUH???That concert was AMAZING!!!I inspire Lindsey.No offense but Lindsey kept getting cut off in midsentence. it was wonderful you did wonderful lindsey stirling!I've been following Lindsey for a while. Definately one of the most 
significant pioneers to appear in a while. She came across a supreme new 
art-form hidden for centuries! She thinks now is amazing, but this is only 
the infant stage. You're looking at the Mother of the Orchestral Dance! And 
one day with influence, perhaps power and wealth, there will be things like 
LS School of Instrumental Dance, Sitrling Harmonic Orchestra, etc. If I was 
a man of faith, I'd say she's a "Prophet" of music! ;)I hope!Me too! :) A tarrr Ah. zan fan shain achkromosoeas schrousch tass vamousah teah
