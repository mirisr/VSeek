Founder Jophess Smith would be furious if he heard this song...﻿My favorite piece! I sang this beautiul song when I was in choir at San 
Diego Academy.﻿I agree with Dix Gib. The vowel sound of the men is so thin to start. To 
their credit is the impeccable diction and precise consonants This 
arrangement is a classic, and Martin's arrangement really brings emotion to 
the depth of the lyrics, "Love so amazing, so divine demands my soul, my 
life, my ALL"﻿Very good. Lose the organ and it could be GREAT! ;)﻿2nd verse
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.﻿Here the organ is the right sound, but the opening in the men's voices is 
too brilliant, not enough covering of vowel sounds. ( It comes off sounding 
a little too cute!) It improves later in the piece.Got a small close-up in this one. See? I really am in the choir!FINALLY! A song that is so close to my heart. This song captures exactly 
all feelings I have for my Saviour.
