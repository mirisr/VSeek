What God has made let no man put asunder!﻿Thank you your imperial highness!﻿I failed to give proper credit; thank you GOD!!!!﻿Are you kidding me? What choir and orchestra does it better than the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir!?﻿He is Risen!﻿Happy Easter﻿Happy Easter!﻿Easter Triumph, Easter joy!﻿Fabulous!﻿Mormans are very far away from being christian so technically this is 
blasphemy
but the song is good﻿Where's John Daker? How can you sing this hymn without John Daker in it? 
lol﻿wonderful song indeed!﻿A fine version of one of my favorites hymns.  Thanks!﻿Just a lovely song with great music. Just love it :-)There is just something about these old hymns that are just so meaningful. 
Not like some of the music today.Evergreen hymn that heralds the easter message better than any other song 
that I can think of . He is risen, what better message for the world 
Refreshing.And if you would like a tour of our beautiful city while visiting please 
let us know. Este hino é muito lindo, amei My God, that was outstanding!SOMETHING FOR US ALL TO REJOICE ABOUT EVERY WEEK OF OUR LIFE.i had this song at my baptismI tend to agree with Carl C. All theology codswallow aside, it is 
undeniable that religions have inspired some of the most wonderful art and 
music the world has ever known.Thanks for sharing this masterpiece!Thank you Nyck461! The conductor is Mack Wilberg.The conductor have a wonderful control of the entire orchestra and singers. 
Not only that but he do his job with confidence. I would like to know his 
name and approximate age. I am not Mormon nor any other sect of Christian, but the Mormon Tabernacle 
Choir is truly spectacular. I need to see them in-person!Something we can rejoice about each and every day.
