peace and quiet and open air, wait for us SOMEWHERE.
There's a time for us.  Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare, time to learn, time to care
Someday, Somewhere we'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving --- Somewhere....Somewhere
There's a place for us. A time and a place for us.
** Hold my hand and we're half way there, hold my hand and
I'll take you there --- Somehow, Someday ---- Somewhere.﻿They are the best choir in the world.  Bar none..this is fabulous﻿THAT WAS VERY NICE. I CAN FEEL THE SPIRIT!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
