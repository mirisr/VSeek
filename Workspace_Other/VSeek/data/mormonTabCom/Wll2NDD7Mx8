beaautiful!﻿Absolutely beautiful!!! Loved it!!!!﻿Beautiful!﻿This is quite a different take on this song, but it is a really cool 
arrangement by Moses Hogan. Impressively memorized and well done. Almost 
magical.﻿Can't imagine actually being present to see and hear.  Thanks, Sylvia and 
Choir, for singing with heart AND voice.  This penetrated my heart at just 
the right time and way.﻿Awful. Killing a splendid hymn﻿
