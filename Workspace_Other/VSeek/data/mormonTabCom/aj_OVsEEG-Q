precision of the MTC. It is extremely difficult to get this level of clear 
diction with such a large choir. Breathtaking! ﻿iese focu, iese focu!!﻿Beautiful! ﻿catalonian is spain ﻿MTC music used to be a staple of the Christmas season in the family, but we 
lost all the CDs in a move.  :(﻿Great song.
This is why I follow all new song from Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
I am not a Mormon but I love all songs from Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 
Orchestra.
The choir have great conductors, organists (specially Elliot), and talented 
singers.
I am curios to know how many hours of rehearsal they spend a week and how 
many sets of different gown they have.   ﻿
