Lords Church!! Never stop singing!ï»¿This is truly a beautiful song, and David does it justice, even though he 
is so young. What a wonderful young man! I truly hope he can stay faithful

1 Be still, my soul: the Lord is on thy side.
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain.
Leave to thy God to order and provide;
In every change, He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul: thy best, thy heavâ€™nly Friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

2 Be still, my soul: thy God doth undertake
To guide the future, as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul: the waves and winds still know
His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.

3 Be still, my soul: when dearest friends depart,
And all is darkened in the vale of tears,
Then shalt thou better know His love, His heart,
Who comes to soothe thy sorrow and thy fears.
Be still, my soul: thy Jesus can repay
From His own fullness all He takes away.

4 Be still, my soul: the hour is hastâ€™ning on
When we shall be forever with the Lord.
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, loveâ€™s purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul: when change and tears are past
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

5 Be still, my soul: begin the song of praise
On earth, believing, to Thy Lord on high;
Acknowledge Him in all thy words and ways,
So shall He view thee with a well-pleased eye.
Be still, my soul: the Sun of life divine
Through passing clouds shall but more brightly shine.ï»¿You can tell that I have never really known much about the Mormons because 
it's shocking to me that they sing hyms and they have a Tabernacle Choir. 
Well good for them. I did watch a Christmas special that was done. I 
watched the whole video of the concert posted on YouTube. It was beautiful. 
David did a good job.

The was one other Mormon that I thought was cool. She is a negro Republican 
and if she is of the same heart and Spirit like David then she deserved the 
win she got.ï»¿He has a wonderful gift from Godï»¿so gracious...well done DA.ï»¿Moved to tears....amazing!!ï»¿So awesome!!! :D :Dï»¿I remember seeing his audition on Idol (when it first aired), I predicted 
he would win.  Close!  Amazing voice!ï»¿any "dragging" is called adding "emotion" the the hymn. I think it's 
awesome. I'll be singing this soon in church as well. Looking forward to 
the opportunity. Woop!ï»¿This is TALENT! ï»¿a little bit dragging in the high notes.... sorryï»¿This is so beautiful ï»¿love this song! one of the dearest hymns...but where can I find this piano 
arrangement??? I would love to sing this in my stake this year :)ï»¿Maravilhosoï»¿so beautifulï»¿So beautiful *sigh* <3  #amen  ï»¿So beautiful and moving.ï»¿Beautiful and awesome voice, but I think that the standing ovation should 
be to God, not to him +Mormon Tabernacle Choir He is just an instrument in 
God's hands :)ï»¿Okay, what else with this kid?ï»¿Amazing voice ;) I love your voice..and I always love your laughed n smile 
its make me laughed :) keep that up that amazing happy spirit you brought 
to others ;) ï»¿Amazing voice ;) I love your voice..and I always love your laughed n smile

to others ;) ï»¿He seems like such a sweetheart. ï»¿The melody is actually a Finnish patriotic song, not national anthem, but a 
very special song to us Finns. It's called Finlandia by Jean Sibelius. I 
think it suits beautifully as a hymn as well. <3ï»¿5 years later and that crystal clear voice still makes your eyes wet....ï»¿I like this guy,its really a blessing Bro.Don't stop and the pianist is

occasionally he does something that truly gives you hope. Thank you for
