Again and again I tell God I need help, and God says, ‘Well, isn’t that 
fabulous?  Because I need help too.  So you go get that old woman over 
there some water, and I’ll figure out what we’re going to do about your 
stuff﻿Why do tears of healing and peace come to my eyes when I hear this . . .﻿Thank you﻿
