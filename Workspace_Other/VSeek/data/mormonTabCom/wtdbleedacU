I need a playlist to have playing quietly while I read the Book of Mormon. 
Could someone possibly make one? It would be nice to have music inspire the 
spirit to enter the room as I read.﻿Very interesting, introspective words Ron.  Thanks for making this...﻿Would be lovely if the choir done a tour in the UK...please!﻿Ron, Thanks for sharing!  I loved Music for a Summer Evening!  I miss you 
guys.  O.K. Meservy﻿President Ron,  great interview!  Your reverence for the spirit of the 
music, your empathetic dedication to the choir members and your sensitivity 
to those of us who listen and enjoy...it's all there.  Thank you.  And to 
your lovely wife who "also attended', we love you both.﻿What is the music in the background? It's beautiful!﻿
