Ah, good. At least they know that 'free' is a one-syllable word.....﻿They sing with such beauty, and yet such economy - usually takes a pop 
"artist" twice as long to get through the anthem. Also, isn't it nice to 
see a group of people move in such a civilized, orderly fashion off the 
field? This group is so impressive. Class.﻿way to fast wtf is that conductor's problem﻿It gives me chills when I listen to the choir sing!﻿Superb!﻿and THAT'S how it's done, son!﻿I Really enjoyed the concert at Carnegie Hall. I have been wanting to see 
MTC for a very long time.﻿I can imagine what experience is listening the choir a live.
God bless the choir.﻿That's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir for you all. That's good for them 
singing in the Yankee Stadium. Never seen it all my life.﻿
