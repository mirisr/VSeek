My favorite hymn. Always good to hear it one more time.﻿Simply magnificent! A beautiful Mac Wilberg arrangement.﻿This spiritual hymnal prayer of thankfulness...has and always will be a 
favorite to sing...or even hum.  The Mormon Tabernacle Choir radiates and 
magnifies with perfect harmony and phrasing.﻿
