#sharethegift   #christmas  Todo Gracias a Jesucristo.﻿What a wonderful season! Thank you for the beautiful music. Merry Christmas 
2014!﻿A tradition that we do in our family. The story of His birth. How our 
children have families of their own, the tradition lives on. ﻿Such a lovely video!  Thank you for sharing the true meaning of this 
season. ﻿Hi everyone...we are LDS, my mom had a big stroke yesterday. She's in the 
hospital in ICU right now....I want to ask everyone out there to pray for 
my mom...Our family really needs her, we are devastated. Pray for a full 
recovery. We need a Christmas miracle, thank you.  ( This is December 2, 
2014) ﻿This was so beautiful! ﻿
