:-).........Heavenly !﻿This is one of my favorite primary songs. To hear it sung by the Mormon 
Tabernacle Choir and see the beautiful places where Jesus lived on this 
earth is so touching, it gives me chills.﻿My Way is very simple. You may follow Me any way you will. But you must 
honour Me in My Christian Churches, everywhere, for I have no other houses 
on Earth. Cults use other houses outside of My Church. When you are asked 
to leave My Church, it will be no different to the time My apostles, during 
My Time on Earth, were asked to do the same thing.

Ignore the taunts, the ridicule and those who use My Teachings and who then 
twist them, so that they can denounce My Messages given to you today.﻿Beautiful!﻿So relaxing & spiritually uplifting after a long day.... thank you 
sincerely for posting these beautiful vids﻿first to view like and comment﻿
