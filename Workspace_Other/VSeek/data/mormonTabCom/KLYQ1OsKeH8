I remember when I was in high school chorus we sang this for our Christmas 
concert. It was a lot of fun to learn and it had the audience in stitches 
XD﻿BRAVA!!!, magnicent soprano acting and performing in a so divine way (she 
is very funny!!!); did not acknowledge her great talent until saw her 
singing the "Suicidio" aria from Gioconda and Andreas Chenier "La mamma 
morta"...for me one of the best ever!!!BRAVA!!!!﻿Had to share this one.  I had never heard it before -- it was hilarious.  
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir always has a good Christmas program, and this 
year certainly didn't disappoint.﻿I heard this song at a concert so I was looking for a version where you 
could understand what was being sung. She did a good job. I wanted to share 
it﻿Traditionally the 12 days of Christmas is not before Christmas BUT AFTER 
and is the lead up to the Christmas celebration of Epiphany and 12 post 
Christmas on the 6th of January when the Wise men are remembered arriving 
at the Saviour .... Each day being a representation of a season... That 
Celebration being when the Saviour was three years old and not a baby but a 
young child. All the Christmas decorations would have been left up until 
this day and taken down on it to mark the end of the Christmas Season...﻿I first learned this song when I was in choir in Texas. I have never heard 
it outside of the church, I wonder if the writer is Mormon?﻿She is very good and know how to make things fun.﻿THAT WAX A GREAT SONG, I HAVE EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE 12 DAYS AFTER CHRISTMAS
I HAVE SOME YOBBOS CHRISTMAS CAROLS, LIKE THE BLOKES 12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS
AND SUMMER WEATHER ETC, ON AARON CLAYTON AND AAA YOUTUBE TV﻿Ehh... I think I'll find someone else to watch my parakeet :/﻿
