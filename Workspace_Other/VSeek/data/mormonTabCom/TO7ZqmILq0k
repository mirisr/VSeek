His pedal work is amazing!﻿Not impressive? No spirit? No sense of Bach? Are you kidding me? I think 
some of the "artistes" commenting on this performance are probably not as 
gifted as they imagine themselves to be.﻿no spirit, and no sense of BachBravo Dr. Elliot! Very scholarly rendition in that it was clearly 
articulated, precise, beautifully registered, and steady as a rock! For 
those of you who don't play organ, this piece is for "Black Belt" organists 
who have high leveled technique. For someone to say unimpressive, is 
strictly a matter of opinion. Regardless of the unimpressed, this difficult 
piece was played beautifully!Who if your impressed or not, it is a talent that not many people have and 
he plays it Wonderfully and especially deserves credit for not reading 
sheet music... Can anybody say sour grapes?I wish *I* could be as unimpressive as this!Dr. Dick Elliott is one of the wizards of organ artistry. His music is 
astounding! Not very impressive. (And yes, I play). But a great sounding organ!I can't even begin to imagine the amount of coordination this takes...Amazing.Totally awesome, but the end got cut off!
