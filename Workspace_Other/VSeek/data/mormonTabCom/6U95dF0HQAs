Sempre maravilhoso...parabéns e muito obrigado.﻿It is a great privilege to hear such a unique and rare Music and The Spoken 
Word to celebrate the great July 4th Independence Day of America.  God 
bless America.﻿The harp piece was spectacular! (10:00)﻿You're only old when your back goes out more than you do.﻿The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, commonly known as a Mormon 
church, teaches Heavenly Father's eternal principles, not man-made stuff, 
like the Catholic church does.﻿Magnificent, as always!﻿I don't know why it struck me as unique or that it just caught me off 
guard, because it's perfectly fine, but the male musician on the harp was 
unexpected. I just haven't seen any other men play that instrument I can 
think of. He does it well, I would wager if I signed up for a class to play 
the harp I would be a very out numbered guy. Sweet.  ﻿This was an especially remarkable program.﻿very beautiful music; very,very well  performed. Thanks  for showing it.﻿Fabulous!﻿the church has many principles and the gifts that we should serve to 
glorify the name of the father﻿beatiful the music  I'd  like  to sing with  the them﻿So beautiful﻿thumbs up...﻿Wonderful! Especially enjoyed watching and listening to harpist Emmanuel 
Ceysson.﻿
