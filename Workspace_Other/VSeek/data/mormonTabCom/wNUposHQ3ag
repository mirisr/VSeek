I just wanted to comment on the organ solo.  It was simple, but nice.  This 
guy's a humble man. Overall nice melody.  I especially liked the 
registration used where the ducks are swimming in the pond and grass lands 
are shown.  I may or may not have heard those before.﻿every time I realize how special songs I hear the choir, helps and comforts 
me...﻿Bravo! Bang the cymbals; let the trumpets blaze and PLEASE more pipe organ.﻿
