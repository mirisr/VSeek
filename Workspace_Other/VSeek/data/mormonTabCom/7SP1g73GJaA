This is my new favorite organ recital. Good job Clay Christiansen!!!I think each has his strengths. Richard has such fine technique at the 
organ and often plays from memory, quite a feat with his busy schedule. 
Clay's internal metronome often lends a fluidity and rubato to the romantic 
literature that the other organists lack.Legato and orchestral color are what that organ does best. Clay has the 
right touch and technique where Richard... is a pianist.
