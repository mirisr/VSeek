Beautiful <3﻿Night time, quiet time,
Loved ones gather at day's end.
I hold them close, I help them know
That God will always be their friend.
Then just before I say goodnight
My little ones kneel by my chair.
I close my eyes, I dim the lights,
And listen to this simple prayer:﻿love my kids,  my angels.﻿Chills.﻿love this hymn.....love my family﻿love this hymn.....love my family﻿we're going to sing this for our stake conference and i just had to stop 
myself from crying every time.﻿Heavenly Father will surely answer our prayers if we pray though Christ 
name.﻿what song are they singing that leads into "A child's prayer"? Anyone know 
where I can get the music for that part?﻿Beautiful. My school choir loves this song.﻿Prayer, before it’s talking, ought to be listening. Before it’s petition, 
it should be audition. Before it calls for eloquence, it requires 
attention. God speaks. We listen. Prayer’s best posture is ears cupped, 
head tilted toward that Voice.﻿Who did this arrangement?   I'd love to do this with our choir.﻿Eu amo esse hino porque me lembro de minha conversão.
﻿This has been one of my favorite hymns since Primary. I love it!!!﻿one black guy one black guy!!!!!﻿For all Moms and Dads, this is one of the most thought-provoking musical 
numbers you will ever experience.  Young or old parents...listen closely to 
the lyrics...and enjoy!  Maybe the Choir will sing this during a 2019 Tour 
of Texas!!﻿I think this is the sweetest primary song :)﻿Heavenly Father will surely answer our prayers﻿
