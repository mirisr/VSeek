I was fortunet to have my son learn the scottish bag pipes in school. He 
had a great teacher. He grew about a foot by the time he was out of high 
school. So he grew into the ablity to play them. He was a pipe major also. 
When I see this vidio it does bring tears to my eyes because of the sound 
of the pipes. I have a theary of music as to the connecting vaulue to our 
past. He even played at his step grandfather funeral. My name is Prunty 
coming from Bronte and love doing research and indexing.I love this video. I may be a bit partial though, because my little girl 
was in it! We are also part scottish. It was an amazing experience with an 
amazing director and everyone else on set were awesome too! Very well done.
