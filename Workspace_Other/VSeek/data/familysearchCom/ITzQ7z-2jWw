I 've been using family search.or for several years now. i found my great 
grandmother's father dating back from Ireland and to Ohio where they settle 
during the 1700s to 1800s I'm proud to have a melting pot of linage's from 
Ireland,Germany,England ended up learning that a few ancestors play apart 
in the civil war and i learn I'm kin to stonewall Jackson and kin to the 
singer johnny cash and i'm half Cherokee and Monacan indian A little over 15 years ago I found out that I have two half sisters. 
Through Ancestry.com, and Family Search.org I found them. Had DNA tests and 
found that we are related. It was a shock for them, and we haven't met yet, 
but still, my long search is almost complete. Thank you all.forever, for all time to day!started in 1956 Trondheim Norway, and doing it every day.
