haha the cute blonde kid... in Ohio....:)Family History encompasses more than genealogy, it really does. It's more 
than finding names. It's about learning the stories behind the names, it's 
about compiling stories, legacies. I think that we need to make "genealogy" 
more accessible to everyone. There's no need for pretense. People are 
intimidated as it is.Frankly, I don't think we should dumb down genealogy. My kids were raised 
with the real word and they love genealogy. Besides, when you talk to a 
"nonmember", they have no idea what you are referring to when you talk of 
family history, unless you are actually writing the history of your family. 
The word genealogy is not a scary word and I even sang "Genealogy, I am 
Doing it", with my primary kids. Didn't bother them and they were learning 
it correctly.I love this one. It is fun to see how these kids know so much more when you 
simply change the words you use.
