Where can we find video of David Archuleta's RootsTech 2015 performance?﻿What an inspiring video! Who inspires me? There are many who inspire me. My 
wife and children inspire me to be the husband and father I need to be for 
them. George Washington, because of his character and leadership.﻿So sweet! I got teary eyed! Thanks for the amazing video! Can't wait to 
attend roots tech on Saturday!! :)﻿
