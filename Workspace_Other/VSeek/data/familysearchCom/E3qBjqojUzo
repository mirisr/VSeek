God loves us all ...! Thank you for sharing your story. I was a missionary in Estonia from 
1996-98 and since then have spent a lot of time researching Estonian 
history. I am even involved with the Estonian ex-pat community in Portland, 
OR. I know very few Estonian-Americans that are members of the Church, 
though and have wondered who is out there. I wish you continued success 
with your family history research!
