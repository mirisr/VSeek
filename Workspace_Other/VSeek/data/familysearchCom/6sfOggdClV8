love it !!!! I love itWELL DONE LOVE THE USE OF CHILDREN.This is a cute and creative idea. I like how it brings kids in especially 
because family history is for kids too. Maybe you will do more videos with 
kids talking about family history or learning family history. A cool part 
about that is if kids are the stars then family history will most likely be 
taught on a level we can all understand.
