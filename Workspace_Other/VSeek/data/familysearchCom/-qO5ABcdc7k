Amazing!! great simple & sweet stuff.. thanks for sharing..Jessie is cute and I found myself on familysearchWhile we don't have these videos in Spanish, you can turn the captions on 
and read them along with the video. Give that a try and see if it helps.gracias por los videos , me gustaría poder escucharlos en español para así 
captarlos más, agradecería me indiquen como lograrlo How do I find the sequence of these 5 Minute Genealogy videos? She suggests 
we watch them in order, but I can't figure out how to find them in order. I have been helping family search with indexing AND working on my family 
history. The hard part is most of my family is from Mexico or Germany. :(
