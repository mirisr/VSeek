Me encanta la historia familiar﻿I don't believe it is captioned in English but if you are looking for 
another language you can see other versions on familysearch. Try going to 
familysearch then click on Live Help, then on Getting Started. You must 
have your browser set to your desired language, such as Spanish or 
Portuguese, etc.Is this video captioned?
