Dennis Brimhall was actually my mission president for about 7 months in the 
Kentucky Louisville Mission. I also happened to run into Sister Brimhall 
while I was there volunteering at the convention during the Friday 
afternoon classes. I look forward to participating and volunteering for 
RootsTech again for 2016.ï»¿
