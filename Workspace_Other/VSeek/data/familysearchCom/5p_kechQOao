INSTRUCTION! Sorry, I didn't mean to yell, but this is sacred work and the 
indtrucions are available along with fild helps, so, if you choose to index 
-- commit to do it by the instruction. There are basi guidelines (document 
112975) and there are project specific instructions. We need to follow 
them. Thanks for the tip! It worked like a charm. And I've needed this for a long 
time!Dear Shanna, you can download it using this website:Keep vid. Enter the 
link, click the grey button on the right (the grey one!!!) then you can 
choose the format. It works! ;) xoxoAre these videos available anywhere besides youtube? Access is blocked in
