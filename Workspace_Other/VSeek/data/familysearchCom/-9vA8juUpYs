I tried two film numbers: 1189887 (Boltz) and 948720 (Kern) both are valid 
LDS numbers, but this search engine does not recognize the numbers. It 
asked for 9 digit numbers only. How do I convert these numbers to the new 9 
digit numbers, and why would someone change the numbering system? Thank you for sharing this on UTube. It sometimes takes us a while to 
relearn old ways of doing things. I will pass on this link to my genealogy 
college students.3 billions!
