MY ANCESTORS COULD HAVE LEARNED MUCH FROM THIS AMAZING WOMAN.Isn't this woman's great, great grandmother Emma Smith? I know I've seen 
those photo's of her before. What a wonderful thing to be able to call her 
your ancestor.someone could wirte subtitles (in english) in order to understand all of 
her speech (cause i don't speak english very well)
