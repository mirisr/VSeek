A couple of years ago I visited the Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor and I 
was deeply moved as I talked to one of the few survivors of this historical 
event. Please, record your family histories and don't let these stories be 
lost! I went an looked at my pictures and to my surprise this is the very 
man I talked with! Just returned from Pearl Harbor; I'm told only 13 men remain. I regret not 
being able to speak to one in attendance that day.wow harsh attack !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yea Whitney :)I was in Pearl Harbor last week during the 70th year anniversary of the 
attack. Only 10 men who were stationed at Hickam Field at the time of the 
attack attended the ceremonies. About 2,400 were killed December 7, 1941 
and many more injured. Most of those who survived have passed on and this 
event moves farther back into the pages of history. Let us not forget those 
who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom that day and for the rest 
of the war.Nice job!!! Whitney nice job!!! :)Great job editing Brandon! DadMy Dad's last sunday on his LDS Mission was Dec, 7, 1941. He arrived home 
and was in the Army Air Corp within one month. I too am proud of his 
service and sacrifice. We remember him to now because he passed away in 
March. He has left us with a legacy that we will strive to live up to.Wow!Thank you for standing your post and helping during a most difficult time 
God BlessThank you for this great video. My father was on the USS Arizona during the 
attack. He jumped off the ship and swam to Ford Island. I am so grateful 
for the selfless service that those men and all the men and women of the 
armed forces give to us.Thank you
