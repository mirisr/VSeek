You just have to meet Curt, he is just a big kid when it comes to genealogyGreat video! Nice to see what other states have on the site. I mainly use 
it for Ohio, but may need it for Indiana or another state someday. By the 
way, That was a neat machine at the begining of the video! Was that some 
sort of microfilm scanner? Interested to learn where to buy one of those 
for my society. :-)
