My husband and I were in the same high school (North Kansas City High 
School) in 1972. There were 3 high schools, NKC, Oak Park and Winnatonka in 
our district, the North Kansas City school district. The three schools got 
together and did a concert of Jester Hairston songs. The neat part was that 
Mr Hairston was our conductor. At the time it didn't seem to be a big deal 
to me but now I see what a wonderful experience it was. I have a 33 LP of 
the concert and so does my husband.You could add to this story that most middle and high school choir 
libraries that have been around a while probably include a number of pieces 
of sheet music by Jester Hairston! I've sung his arrangements, but never 
knew this much about him! Cool!
