I had family members who had a home that got probably about 200 yards from 
the fire. I wish I would have known about the clean-ups, I would have loved 
to join!I didn't even know Pocatello had a fire. I am glad the Pocatello Valley Mormons are helping those who lost 
everything when that fire hitCool
