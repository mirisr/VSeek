What an AWESOME change! On 10/20/12, there were 58,500 missionaries 
throughout the world. On 10/5/13 it had grown to 80,333. Elders can now go 
at age 18, Sisters at 19. Not only are they younger, they are much more 
WORTHY!! I regret that I missed out on being a missionary (translated as 
"act of love") since I didn't join until age 34. But I look forward to 
being a Senior Missionary and serving with my husband in about 4 more 
years. I pray that our health will still be good so that we can serve.I am more excited about the increase in couple missionaries. What iPad app was that missionary using towards the beginning of the video?
