The model taught of effective participation in counsil meetings is greatly 
appreciated. It is not enough just to be there but to come prepared, 
listen, ask questions, evaluate, show mutual concern & respect. It was 
evident that your opportunites for such service have brought not only 
inspired results but much enjoyment in the process. These two things that Sis. Burton said taught me just as much about the 
Priesthood as any man ever has: "The priesthood is not men," and "Equality 
doesn't always mean sameness." As a man in the Church, as a husband, and as 
a Priesthood holder, I care about the women of the Church and am glad that 
these inspired women provide a feminine perspective and speak on behalf of 
LDS women...and their voice is just as important as a man's!
