Salvation and exaltation of families and individuals through the Atonement. 
That's what the Sabbath is. "Sabbath was made for man, not man for the 
Sabbath."﻿"Forewarned is forearmed"...when the Lord's servants counsel us to make the 
Sabbath a time of spiritual renewal those who follow the counsel will be 
prepared for upcoming events and "shall not fear".﻿
