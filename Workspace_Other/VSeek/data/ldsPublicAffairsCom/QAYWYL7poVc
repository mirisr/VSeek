Our wonderful prophet now has to lead the church without his sweetheart at 
his side. How I hope and pray he has the strength and endurance to continue 
to lead us as President Hinckley did when his dear Marjorie died. I have 
faith the the Lord will strengthen President Monson and fill the void in 
his life. Ann Dibb's tribute to her mother was so sweet and heartfelt. (I 
wish I read it at home. I'm in work with tears in my eyes. )64 years in his journals he said it was love at first sight I m so so sorry at the death of the LDS president s wife; they so much 
contributed to the well-being of society as a couple not just for being so 
important people to the LDS church it was simply that the Monsons have a 
good people by themselves
