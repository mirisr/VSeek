I had no idea this was happening! "By their works ye shall know them."Wow, what a great thing these people have done. :-) Thanks for sharing.Awesome vid. This is a fine example of LDS members doing the work Heavenly 
Father wants us to do. May they be blesseed beyond measure for their acts 
of kindness.wow, I'm so thankful Doctors and Nurses can use their talents for such good 
things!So cool they're doing this!! Some of my family members actually had the 
chance to serve at the Tumaco stop, in Colombia :DI am glad there are so many LDS doctors and health care professionals. then 
for them to volunteer their time and skills to help others. thank you.I was amazed at the amount of sacrifice and effort that went into this. To 
me this is Christianity in practice. Next time I would love to be a part of 
it.
