Good morning to you all mormon people. Your church just turned against the 
children of legally married same sex couples. Their requirements for 
baptism are far more stringent than those for children of murderers, 
rapists, pedophiles, and criminals of every ilk. I hope you realize what 
your church has done.﻿zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,take away their tax exemption.﻿view www.mormon.org﻿Beautiful! Where is the chapel from 9:23 to 9:32 located?﻿The Gates of Hell will not prevail against my church.﻿Mormons sound like Christians.Great thoughts Jackie, I agree wholeheartedly!I watched the video and was very touched. I am a member of this church and 
very proud to be...I love how we help others. I KNOW Jesus Christ stands at 
the head of this church and shows us the way to do things. This church has 
been the saving aspect of my life! Jackie Williams As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and this 
video I see as a great tool to share with believers, doubters and those who 
are lost. I would ask that you watch and learn about my faith and then ask 
Heavenly Father to tell you if it is the true church or not.
