Revelation 22:18
I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If 
anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues 
described in this scroll. 
Revelation 22:19
And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take 
away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, 
which are described in this scroll. 
Deuteronomy 4:2 
Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the 
commands of the LORD your God that I give you.﻿i love and truly belive in jesus christ﻿I can fully testify that heavenly father is real and lives, I don't claim 
to know what he looks like duh, that's obvious and I do know that He knows 
every single desire and will work those things through Christ for the good 
of mankind and for all of His precious and wonderful children he gave His 
only son to be reborn baptized and resurrected a perfect being on this 
Earth who dwells here waiting to return in glory and honor.﻿I am a Mormon and believe all of these things. I also believe that Joseph 
Smith restored the gospel in these latter days. Watch my video about it!
