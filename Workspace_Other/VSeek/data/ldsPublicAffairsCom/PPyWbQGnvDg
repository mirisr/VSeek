This is a thrilling event and gathering. I work in Family History and see 
this as an untold event for African American brothers and sister. I am so 
grateful for all who have taken part to bring this to pass.﻿Thank you! This is wonderful! I am so excited! I have been researching my 
family since 1998.﻿Such an amazing work and blessing from God to reunite these families torn 
apart by slavery.﻿What a landmark marvelous thing!  President Sullivan and his wife looked so 
good while announcing this triumphant, important program.  And well, all 
the speakers looked great.  Roots baby!﻿cool﻿
