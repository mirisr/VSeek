Going to Dominican Republic this summer myself to help the poor through 
church.. cant wait to give back to people that dont have it as good as here 
in Europe.. ï»¿i was born in santo domingo. and every time i went to chuch i always felt 
the spirt of the lord. thank you guys for helping out my country keep up 
the good workMy daughter served her Mission in the DR in '07. She loved it there and the 
spirit she felt so strong while serving. Now she and her fiance want to get 
Married in the DR Temple next year! I can't wait to see it! I served my mission there and love that island and its people. how I miss 
it.A wonderful and humble man, an Apostle of God, doing a great job sharing 
the gospel throughout the world! He's right, those people radiate the power 
of the gospel in their lives.Wonderful. Glad to hear that the work is progressing in the DR.This is just wonderful!!! ;)"The Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the 
work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may 
assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, 
nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited 
every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the 
purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the 
work is done."AWESOME!!!!!!!!!The field is white already to harvest!I miss the Dominican Saints... Someday, I'll go back and enjoy their spirit 
and beautiful island...
