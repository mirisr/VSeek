Christ did say " Go and preach the gospel " . But he didnt say preach 
ANOTHER gospel . And most definitely didnt say the Joseph Smith would take 
his place as a prophet .  Galatians 1:7   Evidently some people are 
throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.﻿If you learn and follow the leaders,all the people in Christ name we are 
the leader,I'm the leader according from Acts2:17-21.﻿Some missionaries came to my house last month, I asked what their ultimate 
goal was. All I got were promises that if I read the book of Mormon and 
asked if it was true, there would be an answer. They were empty promises, 
since I've read the book of Mormon twice, and never got an answer.Is there any changes to current age requirementsCan't wait to serve! :)learn an d folow what the leaders sayIs it true that women are allowed to serve for two years now if wished to?Why did they do this years ago?????Super coolThis announcement brought me joy!!! I am one of those young women who are 
now able to serve and have taken lots of thought and pray into that 
decision.its cool to be a mormon!While I am so very grateful for this amazing announcement, I pray that each 
young man and woman who desire to serve a mission will do so prayerfully, 
and not just because they are the right age. With that said, I am so 
grateful my brother has decided to serve a mission as a result of this 
announcement, and I know it will change his life as it changed mine!Every member a missionary..... Age doesn't determine if you can share the 
gospel.
