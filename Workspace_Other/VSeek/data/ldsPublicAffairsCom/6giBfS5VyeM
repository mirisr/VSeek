What peace and joy all experience in service. Both the giver and the 
receiver. If lifting those who struggle isn't Christian, then I guess 
mormons don't worship the same Christ as many others who despise them. What 
good people! People of God!happy to heAr everybody is helping out each other...And by their works you shall know them. You volunteers are my heros. Your 
efforts speak volumes about who we are as members of the Church of JESUS 
CHRIST of Latter-Day Saints. @KolobBabe wow how ungrateful are you its all service no orders and people 
did get sent there, i live in cali and alot of the church left to go help@KolobBabe The mormon church administers aid through volunteers. Even if no 
volunteers showed up to the floods, how can you complain? They aren't 
obligated to. And by the way, I was a mormon volunteer helping sandbag 
during those floods. If you're negatively commenting, and you can't comment 
first-hand, don't comment at all.lol im wearing a mormon helping hands shirt right now!Haha stupid, the Church of LDS did send people to Illinois, Missouri, and 
Iowa.I'm from Galveston and witnessed your goodness first hands. Thank you so 
very much for your help. Our house got 5 ft of water and yellow shirted 
youth from Dallas and Beaumont assisted us. God Bless!besides, nobody gets ordered, its all volunteer work. you know, service? 
what Jesus did.why didn't you?He puts it so simply & honestly,God bless,Brother.Amazing video.It's great to hear the first-person experience.
