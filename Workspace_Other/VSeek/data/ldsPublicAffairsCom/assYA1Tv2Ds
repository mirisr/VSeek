I wonder if one or more of these new Apostles is responsible for the 
subsequent attack on same-sex couples and their children﻿Not a particularly representative group when compared to the membership of 
the Church. They are all male, all white, and -- I suspect -- all 
heterosexual.﻿So they had one day to write a talk?﻿Why did the church edit out the Any opposed part?﻿Did you see the shaking of his left hand at 0:25 min?﻿why aren't there any men of color on that list. is it still whites only?﻿Praise the Lord!﻿0:26 Look at Elder Stevenson's Hand...
You know he feels the weight of this calling, and is rightfully nervous.
I sustain all 3 of these brethren, and wish them the best of luck. The lord 
will uphold them.﻿
