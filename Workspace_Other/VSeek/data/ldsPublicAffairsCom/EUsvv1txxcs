I don't think so. But its not what others think that counts. It how I feel 
about my own worth and how the Savior values me that matters. I know He 
values all of us.I In the Mormon church we are encouraged to make the most 
of what God gives us - as in the parable of the talents. As a result many 
mormons do become high achievers with God's Help.As long as you're a good person, there's no reason for anyone from our 
church or any church to look down on you.Of course not but we do believe that one should work and grow on the 
talents they have been given by God.What if I am not a high achiever,would I be looked down upon @ your Church ?Kudos to this couple who are blessed so much with talents they unselfishly 
share and use to help people. Freely they have received, freely they give. 
They are to be emulated.true blue texan! Thanks for your examples of the happiness that living the 
gospel of Jesus Christ brings!
