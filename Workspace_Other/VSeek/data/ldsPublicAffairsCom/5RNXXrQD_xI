I have a question. I have a bit of a complex story. I'm 28, and have always 
wanted to serve a full time mission. In a sense, I've been preparing myself 
for it for a long time, maybe a little too long. Am I too late? ﻿I´m just 18 days to present me to the MTC of Chile, knowing that i'm 
important to my Father and take part in His sacred plan is magnificent. 
Preach the good news to the regular people is the way to get more happy 
than any other thing can do.I'm not a believer, but I can attest to LDS missionaries being some of the 
kindest and most supportive people I have ever had the pleasure to meet.I can't wait to be a sister missionary! Just a little over a year!I FEEL SO DEEPLY TOUCHED IN MY HEART&SOUL!AND YES I AM A,MORMON WITH MY 
HEART&SOUL!I SAY THIS IN THE NAME OF,JESUS CHRIST-AMEN!
