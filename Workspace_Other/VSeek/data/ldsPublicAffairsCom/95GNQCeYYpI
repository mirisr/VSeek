Thats Nice&God Bless You All,Greetings From 
a,Mormon-From,Europe-Austria-4020-Linz!@DaniDanimalz We are getting one in Indiana too. Our first Temple. It will 
be located outside of Indianapolis, around Carmel. We are just tickled 
about it. My entire family grew up in Payson, so it is about time. LDS members,please 
remember that it is your tithes and fast offerings that make all of these 
Temples possible. Biblically there was only one Temple where the Jews could 
worship in, and that was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70, so now all that 
they have left is the "wailing wall" to congregate at. As LDS, we can build 
as many temples as we want! No more round trips to Provo, we can worship 
here.How many temples does Utah have now?I'M SO HAPPY WERE GETTING A TEMPLE!!!!I wish I could have been there.
