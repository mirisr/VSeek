The Holy Spirit was truly there.﻿Blessed to God on the Highest! May He bless those who love and are will to 
serve Him. How thankful I am for a soon to be built temple in the great 
state of Wyoming :) ﻿It's so beautiful there. I'd love to live in WY.﻿ Those are mighty pretty shovels﻿My paternal grandparents are from Star Valley. So it's nice to see their 
birthplace, one of the most beautiful valleys in the world, get their own 
temple.﻿
