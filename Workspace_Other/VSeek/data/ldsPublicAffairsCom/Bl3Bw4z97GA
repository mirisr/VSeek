Michael, have you ever read the book of Mormon? Let's see if you can 
produce such a work in 90 days, with no revisions, outline, or rough draft. 
Read it, pray about it, ask God if it is true. It is... Fact, stranger than 
fiction. So many attack it, but nobody reads it.﻿The things I learn from the Mormon newsroom are so uplifting and 
enlightening. They give me peace and knowledge and I become a better person 
by watching them. Thank you Heavenly Father.﻿Smith never used a seeer stone, he pulled the BOM from fiction!﻿
