One of the many contributions the LDS church makes to many worthy 
organizations﻿My wife is a mentor for CJC and is helping a sweet little girl through some 
terrible things. My wife also went through CJC when she was young. I am so 
grateful that the Church has recognized the incredible work they do and are 
blessing them for it.﻿I've been a mentor with the Children's Justice Center, and it's great to 
see the church help them accomplish their great work with this donation. ﻿cool﻿
