Completely and utterly confused. In my opinion, this video goes against 
what was just released: mormonnewsroom. org 
/article/church-responds-supreme-court-marriage-rulings You can't play both 
sides, you need to pick a side and stick to it. só lembra que a posição da igreja nunca vai mudar, o objetivo do site é 
ajudar os membros a lidar com um mundo homosexual.totally agree wit u mormonsandgays . orgThis is a really poor video because it is the launching of a new website, 
yet nowhere in the video do they give the new website URL. Even the 
description of the video above does not give the website address. I thought 
the ending of the video should provide the Web address.Thank you! This is much needed and welcome!
