I must say Missionary work has changed my life.. I have become much calmer 
and less aggressive from their teachings and membership in the church. In a 
country where so much chaos and stress can overwhelm I find peace and 
tranquillity in church and home teachings. As I watch my daughter and son 
grow more and more.
