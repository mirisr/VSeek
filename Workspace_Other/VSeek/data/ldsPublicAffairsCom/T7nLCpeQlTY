The Lord's Church not only helps it's member's, but in many diverse ways, 
it helps ALL those in needOh, how I miss being in community with these truths and peoples. I'm out in 
the wilderness, doing God's work, I miss having a ward family so much. One 
day, I hope Heavenly Father will find a way for me to bring the children 
from this world over to that world with me, so I can be there again, too. 
Sigh. I have lived long enough to know what is required of a vehicle to 
Christ - to His love, His atonement, His grace, His example. I miss being 
in the true church. Love to brothers and sisters!!  for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me 
drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; 
I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.â€™
