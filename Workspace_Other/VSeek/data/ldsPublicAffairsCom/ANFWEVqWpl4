I was in the Sapporo Mission in Hokkaido when this happened... This touched 
my heart knowing that I was involved in all of this. I would give anything 
to go back.I was very concerned about all the people affected by the dreadful 
disasters in Tokyo ~ the Saints and the Missionaries were naturally 
uppermost in my thoughts too. I'm sure that the Missionaries rather stay 
and help where they could - I know I would - but obviously, the Church has 
a duty of care to the young men and women. I pray that there will very soon 
be means of transporting the food, water and other necessities to those in 
such desperate need. praise the Lord Amen sonia&familybeautiful!When I heard all the missionaries were alive, my heart rejoiced. I still 
mourn for the tens of thousands who have died though.very touching
