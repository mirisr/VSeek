be, if it were true...What a stupid thing to say. Do you know how many 
people died in that tragedy?It is amazing how God watches over his children.God bless everybody in Japan.My parents are serving a mission in Tokyo and hearing the Elder Holland 
talk about what the church is doing has really eased my mind about their 
safety. Thank-you Elder Holland for the comfort and reassurance you have 
given me.My prayers go out continually. There was a lot of good news in this video!May the Lord continue to watch over His children in Japan. My prayers go 
out to them all.beutifull may the Lord bless us all all the best sonia&familyThis is helpful! Thank You!Incredible. So grateful the Missionaries are all safe. I hope the members of the Church 
are okay and the people of Japan can find peace throughout this terrible 
disaster. God bless them!Mormons are SOOOO cool!
