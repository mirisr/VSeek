You guys are so lucky to have president Pratt there! he is a great 
leader... and very funny person :) I was able to attend couple meetings 
with him here in Chile.I just love missionaries! It's so awesome how they serve so selflessly :)It would be amazing if the church opened a school or even better schools 
here in the UK
