it's a very excellent film! I wasn't able to catch it when I went on 
vacation in the Philippines but fortunately I was able to watch it in 
YouTube through the post of Mormon Channel in Facebook. and after watching 
it twice I posted on my FB..and I sent messages to my cousins and friends 
around the world so that they will also watch it here in YouTube. .. thank 
you to my church leaders..I hope you will make another movie...it's 
fantastic!﻿Sad that David Archuleta belongs to this cult...﻿This is a fun video that I missed from the #meetthemormons  launch. I love 
this film. It's so inspiring, and the cinematography is gorgeous!﻿
