As an active member of the LDS church, I plead with my church leaders to 
refrain from political involvement like this. I live in Texas, but the 
church's involvement in alcohol laws has embittered many of my non-member 
friends and family in Utah. 87% of the church membership lives outside of 
Utah. Are we putting our children and lives in jeopardy living outside the 
"safety" of Utah's liquor laws? Absolutely not. The church's involvement on 
this issue, "protecting" such a small portion of its membership, is doing 
far more harm than good in my opinion.﻿No one from out of state wants to come here, especially for vacation when 
the alcohol percentage is so low.  Utah loses money because of that, aaand 
we just look really stupid.  The only way I can explain it to people is 
"Mormons". ﻿
