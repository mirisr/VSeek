I am so happy to find this video.  I had never known about Faith Counts.  I 
have many friends of different faiths and they are often just as much like 
family as those of my own religion.  This is something that we all need 
more of, all around the world. ﻿We, the people of faith
Together can combat
The world of evil and hate
By being a loving contact﻿Cool. ﻿
