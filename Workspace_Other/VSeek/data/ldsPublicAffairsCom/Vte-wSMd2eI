I'm grateful for the peace, comfort, and knowledge that comes from 
attending the Temple﻿Attempting to live a Christlike life is so much easier with my Temple 
Attendance and the sacred garments I wear.  It also confirms my love and 
devotion and gratitude to my Father in Heaven and His son Jesus Christ, my 
Savior.﻿
