ALEX HALEY ETHIOPIAï»¿I'm a Roots fan, but should FamilySearch be associated with it, considering 
controversy of saga's origin and fact that some of Haley's research has 
been disproved? Roots was inspiration to many (especially blacks) regarding 
history and heritage - even though Haley has admitted that it's work of 
fiction - and most importantly inspired many to seek out own ancestry. Many 
think it's literally historical record; this should be made clear.very nice thank you for sharing..I have fond memories of watching the TV show ROOTS.  Wow that is so cool. I think this new center is awesome.
