What a bunch of loons......﻿in the celebration, i sat right behind the prophet!﻿i do baptisms there!! :)﻿to think that we were once driven out of the state of missouri by forceHow blessed we are to have so many temples on the earth today. By attending 
regularly and showing Heavenly Father that we value and are grateful for 
His Holy House, we will truly be blessed!always good to hear that a temple has been built the work is still going on 
in our church Like I feel very happy for all you lucky people from Kansas City... :) The 
Church is true! The Gospel is so very real and lifechanging even more than 
before...How wonderful is the life lived with the friendship of the Lord :) 
:) :)I toured this Temple with my non member family and had an amazing 
experience! yay!!!
