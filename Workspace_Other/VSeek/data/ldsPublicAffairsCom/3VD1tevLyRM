Because republican ideas match more closely with the church's standards 
than any other political party. Some examples are, the church is against 
abortion and gay marriage, and teaches we should be self-sufficient.Why do most mormons vote Republican????This one was aired in between the sessions ONLINE at LDS.ORG, right? I saw 
it while watching the conference, and it played right before the press 
conference about missionary age adjustments. At this point, I kind of wish 
the Church would just endorse Romney instead of "The Church is neutral in 
matters of party politics." Thanks for posting it! This is a great 
historical year!
