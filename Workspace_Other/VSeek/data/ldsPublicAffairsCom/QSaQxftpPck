The gospel changes lives To grow in many ways Through serving God, one 
thrives In faith and love alwaysWhen I was a missionary I sometimes didn't know what I could have done to 
help. It is good that the organization has experience and inspiration to 
know what to do, and help us to work together and accomplish what I could 
not do on my own.This reminds me of my mission! Such a time of learning, growth, and 
spiritual awakening. The Lord truly guides this church!
