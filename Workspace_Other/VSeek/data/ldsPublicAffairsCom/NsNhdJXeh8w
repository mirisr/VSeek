Matthew 1: Jesus Christ Is Born

Matthew began his testimony with an important family history to show that 
Jesus was a descendent of Abraham and a descendant of king David. To be a 
descendant of Abraham was important because God had promised Abraham that 
his descendants would bless and bring salvation to the whole world (see 
Genesis 12:2–3; Abraham 2:9–11). To be a descendant of King David was 
important because the Jews knew that the Messiah would be a literal 
descendant of David (see Isaiah 11:1–9).Elder James E. Talmage, who was a 
member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, taught that if Judah had been 
continually ruled by kings since the time of David, Mary’s husband Joseph 
“would have been her crowned king; and his lawful successor to the throne 
would have been Jesus” (Jesus the Christ, 3rd. ed. [1916], 87).The story of 
Christ’s birth is also found in Luke 2. Matthew 1 tells the story of Joseph 
and the birth of Christ, while Luke 1–2 tells Mary’s story. As you read 
Matthew 1:18–25, look for qualities in Joseph that would make him a good 
guardian and father to Jesus.﻿
