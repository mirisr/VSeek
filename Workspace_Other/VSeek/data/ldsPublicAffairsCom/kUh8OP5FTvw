Wow. How did I miss this?I still get teary eyed just watching this. How lucky I was to be there. I 
can't wait until the DVD is available.This was the most amazing concert I have ever been to in my entire life, 
and I have been to many symphony and choral events, but NONE of them can 
compare to this one. I will NEVER forget it. Thank you MTC from the bottom 
of my heart.
