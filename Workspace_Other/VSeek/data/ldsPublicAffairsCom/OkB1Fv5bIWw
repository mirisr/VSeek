Fanana banana?﻿the fact that they allowed a muppet vampire into the concert makes me 
wonder…. xD﻿I am so pleased to see Bert and Ernie together again. ﻿When can we watch the full show? Will it be available on Youtube?﻿We were lucky enough to have 4 of our grandchildren join us to see this 
concert. Our two daughters sat in one section with two of their kids and my 
husband and I sat in another section with two more of our grandchildren. 
Unfortunately, two had to stay home. But, we enjoyed it so much! Love the 
Muppets and they didn't disappoint. Loved Santino Fontana, too. He was 
amazing! The whole show was amazing! Can't wait for the DVD. ﻿I cannot stop watching this highlight video! It is fantastic! I am so 
excited for next October!! ﻿I am so sad I missed this!  Tried but didn't get tickets this year.  But I 
am most certainly watching this when it comes out on PBS next year!!﻿They should invite the Muppets to General Conference lol.﻿Watch a few video highlights from this year's Mormon Tabernacle Choir 
Christmas concert and news conference with artist Santino Fontana and the 
"Sesame Street" Muppets™ #MoTab   #Christmas  ﻿
