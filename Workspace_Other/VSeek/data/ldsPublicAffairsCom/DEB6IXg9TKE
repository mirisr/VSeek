Hi DaidojiTomoyo, they waited until the school year finished so all the 
seniors could graduate, but the students who didn't graduate that year had 
to find another school. I graduated from that great high school. Greetings.But what happens to the students who attend the high school? Is there 
another school nearby that they have to transfer to?Go Gospel!! An exciting time to be a part of the Lord's work.
