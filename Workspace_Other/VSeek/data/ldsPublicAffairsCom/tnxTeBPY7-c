So missionaries here in Brazil won't get them.﻿i had better tech in CA San Jose 94-96. I had flip charts and hand motions﻿What a great news!!! This will improve the work of the Lord...I wish I was 
able to use more technology in my mission, but Im happy for this new 
generation of missionaries that will be able to use this.  I just hope that 
mission president will be on the same page with the First Presidency and 
allow the missionaries to use it﻿
