This coming from a spokesmen of the Church where this very Church condones 
drinking every day including Sunday on it's Church owned 5 Billion dollar 
mall in Salt Lake City, UT. City Creek. Not only are they condoning alcohol 
drinking, but they are likewise condoning breaking the Sabbath day by 
allowing restaurants to be open and serving alcohol.I guess the almighty 
dollar is more important then following their own beliefs. They likewise 
charge for parking on Sunday. I guess it's not filthy luckier since after 
all the money is going to the Church right? I guess unrighteousness is ok 
in their eyes if they are the one's that approved it, it's just not ok for 
anyone else, Hypocrisy is what they are best known for! It's interesting 
that he insinuates everyone that has a drink is a raging alcoholic and is 
responsible for all the ill consequences to society that drinking causes. 
Then goes on to say Utah is the best in the nation. It's nice for him to be 
puffed up in pride about this. To bad he can't say the same about suicide 
in Utah. Why not pick up more than one stick. What's weird is there is a 
double when it comes to their themselves. BTW has anyone else ever heard 
anyone use the word poder? did he learn this word from his grandparents?﻿The non-drinker thinks it's reasonable. Lol! Free agency at its finest. ﻿If the Church really wants agency they should stop with this destruction of 
choices. The facts he brings up aren't even relatable to this problem.﻿In Utah I'm a strict conservative, but everywhere else color me a 
libertarian. ﻿
