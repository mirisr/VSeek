Yo fui bendecida con esta ayuda... I am shocked that there are no comments on this video yet! What an 
inspirational gem showing families of all race and color holding hands and 
secure in the fact of their eternal progression to Celestial glory!. Look 
at all the Latinos and Blacks now embracing these plain and precious truths 
of the LDS faith! I am proud of the LDS Church for its extensive 
humanitarian programs throughout the world. Are there any latter day saints in Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka?
