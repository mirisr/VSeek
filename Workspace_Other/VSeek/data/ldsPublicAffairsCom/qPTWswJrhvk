explain its policy at BYU that a student who leaves the LDS church is 
expelled, even if their new church would be willing to provide an 
ecclesiastical endorsement?  Students of another faith can leave their 
church and join the LDS church and remain a student, but not the other way 
around.﻿This is a beautiful video and I enthusiastically share in the desire for 
world-wide human rights and freedom of religion; however, as an American 
citizen, doesn't the legally-binding United States Constitution trump this 
United Nations wish list? Respectfully, Reid  ﻿
