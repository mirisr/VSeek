Reach a common ground
Expressed in charity
There the spirit's found
In Christ for unity

My husband sings in Gladys Knights Saints United Voices.  They did the same 
thing a couple of Christmases ago in Las Vegas.  It was wonderful!﻿This is super cool! Great way to follow Christ's example and love our 
neighbors.﻿
