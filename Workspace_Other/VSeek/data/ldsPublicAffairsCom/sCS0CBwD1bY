What a wonderful coming together of different faiths in single very 
important principles.﻿I liked what Bishop Wester said, that when a couple come together to 
support, compliment each other and raise a family they complete the face of 
God in their home.﻿I am grateful that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained by God.﻿
