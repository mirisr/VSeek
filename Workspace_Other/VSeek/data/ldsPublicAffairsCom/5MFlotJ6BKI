Oh that helps so much. I'm so relieved. With the world spiraling downward 
at an ever quickening pace I never would have thought this is the greatest 
season for the Church. Wickedness growing so quickly and protection from 
that wickedness diminishing so quickly. Now I don't have to worry. Mine 
afflictions are swallowed up in Christ. Thank you Brother Bednar, you serve 
wonderfully as Heavenly Father's tool. I thank Him for you.ï»¿
