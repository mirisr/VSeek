@omiolo2 the second coming is near..so what is your standpoint what do you 
believe?@omiolo2 I'm not sure about the Second Coming, but I do enjoy going to the 
website and am learning a lot about the LDS. I think it is tremendous that 
the Church is not afraid to use new media to reach out to prospective 
converts. Sometimes it is a little scary to think about talking to 
missionaries, so the website is a great place to start. Love the searchable 
profiles! Thank you.The new mormon.org is GREAT! Can't wait to continue on in this "new phase" 
of missionary work!I love the new website it's about time we had something cool and modern, 
great work. I do think this video could be edited slightly better, less 
jumpy!I think the new media will help the missionary take off like never before. 
The Second Coming is near. Yay! I love the site! =D So exciting! Thanks for these videos. Keep it up. 
How are we going to know when new video profiles come up? Can we get an RSS 
feed?@rtardbox I know one thing for sure my friend, in doing this, he is doing 
the Lord's will In all things.
