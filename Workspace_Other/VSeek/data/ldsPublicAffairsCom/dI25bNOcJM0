I look forward to the Mormon Tabernacle Christmas special every year, but 
this production was exceptional. I was riveted! Thank you to the Mormon 
Church for this wonderful gift! Please tell me someone gave them a Book of Mormon! :)I saw this last Sunday and was amazed at the spirit that filled that 
Conference center. What a beautiful production that spoke about the true 
meaning of Christmas! thank you so much!The show was AWESOME!!! Thanks Jane & Nathan!!!Technical comment to LDSPublicAffairs: Is the volume of the video a bit low 
or is it my computer?
