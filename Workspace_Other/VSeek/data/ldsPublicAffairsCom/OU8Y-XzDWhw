Elder Evans is the man! He gave one of the best trainings when he came and 
visited the Texas Dallas Mission a couple years ago when I was erving there.I completely agree on sisters of the Church having a joyful response 
immediately after President Monson's response, because I was one of them! 
So excited to serve the Lord for 18 months pretty soon! This is the Work of the Lord!
