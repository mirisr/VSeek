I think it is good that the LDS Church decided to defer to the Jewish 
concerns in this instance. We must always remember to be sensitive in such 
matters. And we can know that if those who have passed on want the 
ordinances done, eventually they will be done. No need to make enemies 
among the living.Most Jews that I speak with just think this practice is weird but 
understand that the LDS people do it as a gesture of goodwill and love from 
their religious perspective.
