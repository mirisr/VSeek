WOW !!! i'm glad that you can't Substitute, Counterfeit,  And Pretend that 
not have AS Man AND A Woman, Being A loving Couple and A bond of True 
Honest and Loving Relationship, Of One Eternal Unity:) ﻿President Eyring's universal message would surely transform our broken 
world. ﻿I had the humbling experiences associated with literally sitting at the 
feet of this man, Pres Eyring's feet, when he was called and serving as 
Pres of the then Ricks College, and a Book of Mormon class for credit was 
offered there, so many years ago. The spirit bore witness to me, back then, 
literally that this man had so much to yet do, and that the Lord was moving 
him to become one of His chosen. It is a pleasure to still 'be taught at 
his feet', any time and in any place. What a blessing. The church continues 
being in the 'best hands' for our guidance from the Lord.﻿This was an awesome experience for the church, before the world. Our 
leaders, through modern ongoing prophecy, some few years ago, gave to us, 
the world, the Proclamation on Marriage. It will stand forever, as literal 
prophecy and revelation from our Heavenly Father. What a 'testimony 
building' experience for all of us, to hear Pres Eyrings' message, and 
knowing that the Lord called for he, and the others to attend.
Never give in nor give up, on wanting to be eternally successful in an 
Eternal Marriage in a couples lives.﻿So awesome, I would love to be there.﻿Where can we listen to Eyring's address?﻿What a great message of what makes a happy marriage.﻿Watch this recap from the second day of the Vatican marriage summit, where 
Pres. Eyring called for a "renaissance" of happy marriages. Read more:
