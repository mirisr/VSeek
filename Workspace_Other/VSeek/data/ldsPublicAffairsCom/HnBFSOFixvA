How cool is that?!? =)The Tabernacle in Idaho Falls, where the D. I is now, had an incredible 
Baptismal Font. It was surrounded with live plants and a huge bay window 
floor to ceiling. This is where I was baptized. We all felt such a horrible 
loss when it came down. The huge spiral staircase led to a remarkable 
ballroom and the chapel was incredible, with, I believe, dark mahogany, 
carved and turned wood and dark red velvet upholstery. Cherished memories.Wow! I live in walking distance and I find this out in YouTube!That man, Benjamin Pykles, was my branch president before he moved to Utah! 
Hi President Pykles, glad to see you're making a name for yourself!Wonderful historic ruins - fantastic! Curious, though... one of the workers 
in this video mentioned the Provo Tabernacle being the only example of a 
font in a tabernacle, other than Temple Square. The Brigham City Tabernacle 
has a font in it. I don't know if it's older than Provo's tabernacle or 
vice-versa, but it's noteworthy nonetheless. It's very pretty! What's the official color of that brick?This is very interesting.
