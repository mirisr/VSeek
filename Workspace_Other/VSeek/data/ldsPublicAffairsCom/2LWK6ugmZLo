What a wonderful Idea...It's amazing & with the backdrop of the actual 
temple behind...Truly breathtaking.Oh good I'm glad this is online! :) I recently got to view it in person at 
the Salt Lake Temple's visitors center and was hoping to find a video so 
that I could show my non-member friends who are mislead into thinking that 
we keep our temples a secret because we must do weird/bad things in them. 
It's not a secret, it's just sacred :) Fantastic! This should help some skeptics understand us a bit better.40 AÑOS DE PERSEVERANCIA DE PRUEBAS PARA LOS SANTOS DE LOS ÚLTIMOS DÍAS EL 
TEMPLO ES LA CASA DEL SEÑOR DONDE SE HACEN CONVENIOS POR LA ETERNIDAD.This is really a great idea. It will take away much of what the outside 
world thinks about the secrecy of what is inside a building that they can't 
go through. @builderkeys For the same reason why the children of Israel needed to be 
prepared and made clean before being brought into the presence of the Lord 
at Mt. Siani. Mountains and temples are synonymous in scripture. how come some church members are not allowed in?I keep meaning to see this. Wow I love it. It was a great idea to do this.They could make replicas like this one to each Temple. That way the 
non-member families can feel more invited. Me and my husband are going to 
be sealed in December, and my family cannot enter the Temple, so it makes 
them feel a bit sad. When they could at least see how it looks like inside, 
they would feel much better. Right now I just have to show them some 
pictures. But Salt Lake Temple replica truly is a wonderful idea! :)They could make replicas like this one to each Temple. That way the
