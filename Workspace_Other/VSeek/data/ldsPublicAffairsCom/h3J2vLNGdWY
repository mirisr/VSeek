This is beautiful! I was a young child church helped my family for years 
even though my mom didn't convert till after my brother and I.i've never 
had such love and assistance shown to me then by the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter Day Saints! Now my husband and I get to serve as missionaries and 
give back and serve the Lord! I see every day how the church helps people 
that are not even interested in the church or who are nonmembers. They want 
to help others become self-reliant and show the love and charity that Jesus 
Christ taught.﻿Love this video it is so true!!!!!﻿I didn't know the church did so much humanitarian stuff.
