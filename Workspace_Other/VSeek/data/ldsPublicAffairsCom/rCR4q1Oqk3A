I am not a Mormon, I have never been to Provo. But I was saddened to see 
the old tabernacle burn and I have been checking back from time to time to 
see what the renovation, if any, would look like. It does not seem so much 
like a restoration. Seems more like a new building with part of the old 
building retained as a sort of top cover. Well, I hope it works out for 
them, and safely. Will be interesting to see how it turns out. Temples are heavy in symbolism. Different temples have different means of 
bringing that about....all of which point to the marvels of God. I think 
the symbolism of build from the rubble to something greater is a beautiful 
and appropriate symbol for a house of the Lord. They did the same thing to Christ Church cathedral in 1987 in Montreal. As pessoas precisam conhecer melhor a história dos pioneiros e todo o 
sacrifício feito para que hoje possamos desfrutar das bençãos completas em 
nossas vidas e muitos destes edifícios são parte disto. but it shouldn't matter about the history, it should just matter that 
ordinances that can be preformed. The earthly history is irrelevant long 
run. re-built means a new temple... and a new temple has no historyThis building has huge historic & spiritual significance in a town rooted 
in its past & present faith. Personally, I have sweet memories of my oldest 
as a baby crawling up & down the front spiral stairs. I was heartbroken 
when it burned; fearful of its uncertain future; then overjoyed that it was 
to be renovated. It probably would be cheaper to just rebuild, but it 
wouldn't be the same. And it's not hard to understand the symbolism of an 
edifice ravaged by fire, and reborn to a higher purpose.why go to that much trouble. why not rebuilt the thing?
