I liked his calming and reasurring voice in his talks.﻿Richard﻿ES EL MEJOR CANAL QUE PODEMOS TENER﻿What an amazing man. I met him twice and he was larger than life (even at 
5'5")! He will be missed, but I'm glad he is reunited with his sweetheart.﻿Thank you Elder Scott members from the Philippines Love you!!!﻿Pra mim ele o melhor apostolo que já tinha visto, um grande profeta na 
verdade. Fique com Deus Elder Richard G. Scott﻿I love the spirit I felt when I heard him testify of Jesus Christ.﻿Love you elder Scott. ❤️﻿He will be missed. After having listened to him and others of the twelve 
now gone too, it is like losing a family member. The lord bless his 
immediate family in this time of grief.﻿I can't believe there are now 3 vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve. 
Thank you Elder Scott for all you have done helping us to see the path we 
should take. God bless your memory.﻿What a truly great and Christlike man. He cam and spoke at the MTC while I 
was there, and afterwards, stayed and shook each of our hands. There were 
several thousand of us there and he wanted to take the time to shake each 
of our hands. That will always stay with me.﻿Sitting at my computer, I was surprised to see this news in lds.org. I 
didn't know Elder Scott was ill, but I love him and all he is done 
furthering the work of the Lord, especially his special witness of the name 
of Jesus Christ.﻿What a great man. He will be missed greatly. Until that later day, dear 
friend.﻿
