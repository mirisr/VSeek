The opening should have shot it in 24 frames per second instead of 30-60 
frames per second. But the rest of the video is Great, (and so is the 
beginning but it could have been shot in 24 FPS)!I have to take my hat off for their passion and effort for their 
believes....I really wish that we, Christians have the same passion for 
what the Gospel really is. Both my wife and I graduated from seminary in Columbia South Carolina in in 
1968. It is a very short four years; but the preparation of a solid 
foundation to receive and live the Temple covenants and the depth of your 
testimony of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice and how to apply it to 
our likes will live with me forever. The decisions I made and kept during 
my seminary years greatly helped determined the type of person I am today.Seminary definitely helped me make it through some of the trials that I 
faced when in high school.This is a lovely video! I am so grateful to have attended seminary from 
1979-84, and my husband served on the Seminary council for the historic 
Granite High School Seminary from 1980-82.
