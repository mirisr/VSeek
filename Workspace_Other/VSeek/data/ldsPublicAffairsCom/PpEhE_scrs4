Why do you guys think native americans are cursed?﻿Where are the missionaries called to serve in the Bronx, El Paso, or 
Lafayette, LA...﻿Excellent video, wonderful christians,﻿I love being a missionary! I benefit the most by serving my Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ.it is a pleasure to serve the Lord! It is not a sacrifice as I 
have been so extremely blessed by God. Spiritual things must be discerned 
spiritually.﻿ You must be prepare to assist as a member LDS and be baptized and other 
additional rules.﻿I want to become a missionary someday too.I love missionary work! :)﻿"and also study the gospel of Jesus Christ." Why does the gospel need to be 
studied?﻿We sent our first missionary out yesterday and I'm still in MMS (Missionary 
Mom Shock). I look at the clock and wonder what our son is doing right at 
that moment in the MTC. This video answers some of those questions. It's an 
honor to be the parent of such a great young man and I'm excited to watch 
him grow. Thanks for the video.I love this video. I served in1995. I loved the MTC :DI love missionary work! It's incredible all the good missionaries do!Simply amazing, to learn to teach in Chinese in just a few months.Such amazing selfless young people!This is a great video, it strengthened me, because l will be set apart as a 
missionary next week.Keep up this great work. I am so proud to be a Latter Day Saint. I am a 
convert and have not served a Mission. I am so happy to have been given the 
joy of seeing this video knowing that the 2 missionaries that brought me to 
the church were and are a part of this.
