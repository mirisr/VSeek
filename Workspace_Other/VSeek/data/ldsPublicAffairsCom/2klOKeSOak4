@BlackJacx1 Concordo perfeitamente com vc!Can't wait to get the rest of the collection! My son has the first 2 
volumes & loves them!! 8-)I look forward to getting the book and reading it myself.It'll be nice to have pictures of actual documents, rather than snippets, 
notations, and misquotes from people who are anti-Joseph Smith. So that 
people can see what kind of man he really was/is. It will make the 
testimony of the restored gospel stronger, and help dispel confusion and 
deceptions about this great Prophet of God!
