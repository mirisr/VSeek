and our world Franco III﻿This is incredible. I want to visit this place so bad, once it is completed 
:)﻿My favorite part is the Michelangelo mountain of white stone, the 
recreation of the Christis and 12 Apostles statues. Technology is so 
amazing, a miracle.﻿It was beutifully done and will really help the LDS Church improve it's 
missionary program. There is so much to learn in this world. ThxDefinitely, so white and delightsome! oh my Lord...bahala na kayu sa kanila...mi fa gran piacere sentire le notizie da questo tempio dal signiore al 
piaese da miei antinati e dove servito la mia missione :) ... Miei antinati 
la famiglia Gigli venga da Massa Carrara... bellllllllllisssssssiiiiimoooo! What beautiful, pure white marble, so symbolic of the savior of the world.!GOD BLESS YOU DEAR SISTER!The gospel moves forward across the world. This is a wonderful. The world needs more temples. What a great location and beautiful building.Wow.Grazie mille! I have been waiting patiently for this video to be uploaded 
ever since I saw this segment during General Conference. Soon after the 
announcement of the building of the Rome Temple I knew that there would be 
special consideration for this project and the addition of the 12 Apostles 
to the Christus statues for the visitors center only proves that my 
feelings were correct.
