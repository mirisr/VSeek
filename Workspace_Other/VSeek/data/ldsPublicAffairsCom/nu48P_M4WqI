As solar and batteries are made more efficient it shall become more 
widespread. Make no mistake, it is the future@rtardbox PV solar systems in metropolises like Farmington utilize 
grid-tied PV systems that do not require battery storage. Check our the 
FACTS! PV systems pay for themselves multiple times by offsetting 
electricity usage. It's a good investment and also helps the environment.@rtardbox We are trying to be self sufficient and conserve.I applaud the LDS Church and their desire to conserve energy and natural 
resources. This stand alone efficiency is nice to see. @rtardbox Farmington, Utah is not densely populated. A city of 12,000+ is 
not exactly a booming metropolis. Also, this was set up as a pilot 
program...it is not Church-wide. It is more expensive because of the 
initial cost in the short-term, but saves considerably in the long-term 
and, most importantly, it conserves energy. I disagree that it is a PR 
stunt. The LDS Church is being environmentally responsible. Why shouldn't 
the LDS Church test alternative forms of energy?
