I live kinda near and it is soooo COOL!I would like to see them leave it open for tourists after the movie is 
completed.I wonder, did everything in Jerusalem look 2,000 years old 2,000 years ago?Awesome, maybe when it's finished they can give tours!wow, that's pretty cool!CoolAwesome, I want to see movies film there!It's probably safer than filming in Jerusalem.that's cool! The movie set would be really spectacular to go through when 
finished. Wonder when? I'll wait :]
