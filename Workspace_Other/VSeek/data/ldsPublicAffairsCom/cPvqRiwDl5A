I'm save by Joseph Smith and the need to graduate﻿We need to stand up and do something about this new society of 
hypocritical, bigoted and narcissistic martyrdom that prejudges people to 
be bigoted or vain just for having different views. I mean all views. 
However, religious freedom is more under attack than ever and whoever 
doesn't do something about it brings it upon themselves. We ourselves, We 
the People, must enforce our rights to follow our own moral consciences. No 
human being has the right to take another human being's dignity and meaning 
away. We need to stand up for every one's right to follow their own moral 
conscience, especially in this new world of temporary standards without 
foundation.﻿remember... freedom for some is not freedom for all﻿This video is fantastic. Thank you all who support religious freedom.﻿there is no attack on religious freedom.﻿
