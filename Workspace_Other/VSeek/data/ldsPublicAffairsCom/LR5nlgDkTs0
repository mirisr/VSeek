I have got to stop in here next time I head to SLC!﻿I live in Salt Lake City just blocks away from Temple Square. I'll go visit 
sometime. I thank the leaders of the Church for this blessing to learn of 
our history.﻿I like how the Church is becoming (although to tell the truth it really has 
no other choice) more and more open about discussing all aspects of its 
history﻿YAY! I will have to try to go when I am in Salt Lake City for conference 
this weekend :)﻿
